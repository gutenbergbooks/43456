<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Arriving in Shanghai.</span></h3>

<p>It was in the merry month of May, 1887, that I first
landed in China; but from the first there was
nothing merry about China. It felt bitterly cold, after
passing through the tropics; and in Shanghai one
shivered in a warm wrap, as the wind blew direct from
the North Pole straight at one's chest, till one day
it suddenly turned quite hot, and all clothes felt too
heavy. Every one almost knows what Shanghai is
like. It has been admirably described over and over
again, with its rows of fine European houses fronting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
the river, the beautiful public gardens and well-trodden
grass-plats interposed between the two; with its electric
lights and its carriages, and great European stores, at
which you can buy everything you could possibly want
only a very little dearer than in London. There used
to be nothing romantic or Eastern about it. Now,
darkened by the smoke of over thirty factories, it is
flooded by an ever-increasing Chinese population, who
jostle with Europeans in the thoroughfare, till it seems as
if the struggle between the two races would be settled
in the streets of Shanghai, and the European get driven
to the wall. For the Chinaman always goes a steady
pace, and in his many garments, one upon the top of
the other, presents a solid, impenetrable front to the
hurrying European; whilst the wheelbarrows on which
his womankind are conveyed rush in and out amongst
the carriages, colliding here and there with a coolie-drawn
ricksha, and always threatening the toes of the
foot-passenger. Too often there are no foot-pavements,
and the whole motley crowd at its very varying paces
is forced on to the muddy street. Ever and anon
even now a closed sedan-chair, with some wealthy
Chinaman from the adjacent Chinese city, threads its
way in and out among the vehicles, noiseless and
stealthy, a reminder of China's past glories. There
are also now wholly Chinese streets in the foreign
settlement, where all the shop-fronts are gorgeous with
gilding and fine decorative Chinese characters, where
all the shops have signs which hang perpendicularly
across the street-way, instead of horizontally over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
the shop-front as with us, and where Chinese shopkeepers
sit inside, bare to the waist, in summer
presenting a most unpleasing picture of too much
flesh, and in winter masses of fur and satin.</p>

<p class="caption">SHANGHAI CREEK, WITH DRAWBRIDGE.</p>
</div>

<p>Shanghai has got a capital racecourse, and theatre,
and cricket-ground&mdash;grounds for every kind of sport,
indeed. It has a first rate club, and an ill-kept museum.
Its sights are the bubbling well and the tea-garden
in the China town, believed by globe-trotters, but
erroneously, to be the original of the willow-pattern
plate. Beside this, there is what is called the Stone
Garden, full of picturesque bits. A great deal that is
interesting is to be seen in the China town by those
who can detach their minds from the dirt; in one part
all the houses have drawbridges leading to them. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
even the Soochow Road in the foreign settlement has
never yet been treated pictorially as it deserves. It is
the Palais Royal of Chinese Shanghai. At the hour
when carriage traffic may only pass one way because of
the crowd, it would reward an Alma-Tadema to depict
the Chinese dandies filling all its many balconies, pale
and silken clad, craning their necks to see, and by
the haughtiness of their gaze recalling the decadent
Romans of the last days of the empire. Their silken
garments, their arched mouths, the coldness of their icy
stare, has not yet been duly depicted. <i>Chun Ti Kung</i>,
by the late Mr. Claude Rees, is so far the only attempt
to describe their life. Yet they, too, have souls possibly
worth the awakening. With their long nails, their
musk-scented garments, their ivory opium-pipes, and
delicate arrangements of colours, they cannot be without
sensibilities. Do they feel that the Gaul is at the
gates, and that the China of their childhood is passing
away?</p>

<p>It is this China of their childhood, with here an
anecdote and there a descriptive touch, which I hope
to make the English reader see dimly as in a glass in
the following pages, which are not stored with facts and
columns of statistics. People who want more detailed
information about China, I would refer to Sir John
Davis's always pleasant pages; or to my husband's
<i>Through the Yangtse Gorges</i>, containing the result of
years of observation; or to dear old Marco Polo's
account of his travels in the thirteenth century, revivified
by the painstaking labours of Colonel Yule, and thereby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
made into one of the best books on China extant. For
my part, I shall endeavour to make the reader see China
and the Chinese as I have seen them in their homes
and at their dinner parties, and living long, oh! such
long summer days among them, and yet wearier dark
days of winter. And to make the reader the more
feel himself amongst the scenes and sights I describe,
I mean to adopt various styles, sometimes giving him
the very words in which I at the time dashed off my
impressions, all palpitating with the strangeness and
incongruity of Chinese life, at others giving him the
result of subsequent serious reflections.</p>

<p>But here let me record my first great disappointment,
because it may be that of many another. Brown mud
is the first thing one sees of China. Brown mud accompanies
the traveller for miles along the Yangtse River,
all along the Peiho, up to brown and muddy Tientsin,
and on up to Peking itself. China generally is not at
all like the willow-pattern plate. I do not know if I
really had expected it to be blue and white; but it was
a disappointment to find it so very brown and muddy.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">My First Tea-season.</span></h3>

<p>It was dull and leaden all the six hundred miles
up the great river Yangtse; and at first it poured nearly
all day and every day at Hankow, and we shivered
over fires. Nevertheless, in spite of absolutely leaden
skies and never a glimpse of sunshine, the coolies and
the twenty-years-in-China-and-don't-speak-a-word-of-the-language
men wore sun-hats, and pretended to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
ill from the glare, when any one fresh from England
would certainly say it was the damp. The floods were
all the while advancing on what looked like a beleaguered
city, when we went out on the plain outside,
and gazed back at the city wall, with its dark water-line
clearly marked all round close to the top.</p>

<p>The country round certainly did not tempt one to
go out very often on to the rotten flag-stoned way by
which one walked three or four miles in order to reach
a one-mile distance as the crow flies, feeble-looking
corn and marsh at either side, with an occasional
tandem of buffaloes groaning not in unison with the
discordant creaking of the cart they drew. Yet we
plodded past the little homesteads, each planted on its
own artificial hill, faced with stones on the side the
floods come from. The very friendly people all used
to come out of their cottages, and call out, "Do rest
with us awhile," "Come in, do, and have some tea";
but till I spoke a little more Chinese, I did not care
to repeat this often: though I rather enjoyed the first
time going in and having tea, delicious tea, brought
us at once&mdash;next a pipe, and then a bowl of water.
Nothing could be friendlier than the people; and somehow
or other I used to fancy from the first I held quite
conversations with them. But what we either of us said
to each other in words it is impossible to tell; there is
so much one understands without knowing the words.
So on and on we used to plod, resisting all kindly
pressure to turn in, till gradually the reflection of the
setting sun gave a red glow to the water in the ruts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and frogs hopped in numbers across the path, and bats
whirled after mosquitoes. Then at last by an effort
we summoned up will enough to turn, and plod just
exactly the same way over the selfsame stones back
to Hankow, the beleaguered city, with its avenues of
over-arching willows, and beautiful Bund half a mile
long&mdash;a mile walk up and down, therefore, as every one
takes care to tell you the first day you arrive, as if
afraid lest, stricken by a sort of midsummer madness,
you should actually leave the English settlement, with
its willows and its villas, and attempt to penetrate into
the Chinese town.</p>

<p class="caption">TEA-GARDEN IN SHANGHAI CHINESE CITY.<br />
<i>Believed by globe-trotters to be the original of the willow-pattern plate.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The stories I heard about the Chinese town gave
me quite a feeling of excitement the first time I went
into it. People threatened me with horrible sights,
and still more horrible smells. But I fancy those,
who talk in this way, can know very little of the
East End of London, and nothing of the South of
France or Italian towns. Hankow certainly struck me
as very fairly clean, considering how crowded its streets
are, and the people at that time for the most part as
wonderfully civil. I should not care to hear the shower
of abuse, that would greet a foreigner in one of our
English towns, who turned over and examined all the
articles on a stall, then went away without buying anything,
as English people do not hesitate to do there.
The Kiangsi and Hunan Guild-houses are both well
worth a visit, although the former has been in large
measure burnt down, and thus stripped of those wonderful
coloured tiles about which the few, who have seen them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
are still enthusiastic. Most people have never seen
them at all. As it is now, the temple to the god of
literature at Hanyang has more charms for me, with
its many curved roofs making such an harmonious,
rich, dark medley. However, of course in Hankow
no one in the month of May is thinking about architecture.
"Thou art not science, but thou <i>tea-chest</i>
art" is the riddle they were all engaged with, and
they were very sad over it. For the tea was bad;
and though the Chinamen had bound themselves under
awful penalties to have no second crop, yet of course
the second crop would be there soon. I looked sadly
at the men from Hunan, sitting so truculently in their
boats, with their pigtails twice coiled round their heads,
counting over beforehand the gains they meant to take
back home; for probably there would be none. We
talked tea at breakfast and tiffin and dinner, and we
took it at five and considered its quality. But that
would not make the people at home give up Indian
tea, with all its tannin and nerve-poisoning qualities.
So in between-whiles we counted up how many suicides
there were last tea-season. For Chinese have a fine
sense of honesty, if not of honour; and merchants are
apt to kill themselves, if they cannot meet their
obligations. "There will be more suicides this year,"
said first one, then another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the pretty painted boxes streamed past
the house at the rate of eighty a minute sometimes&mdash;always
noiselessly carried by coolies in huge sun-hats,
and too often through the dripping rain. And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
great gamble went on, and the men who dropped
in to call looked wearier and wearier. But that was
all in 1887, which might almost be called the last year
of the great China tea trade of which Hankow had
since 1861 been the centre. There was quite a fleet
of ocean steamers there even that year to take the
tea away; in 1898, barely one for London. English
people will not drink China tea. It is so delicate that,
though in itself inexpensive, it comes dear from more
leaf having to be used to produce the same strength
of liquor. But it is soothing, whilst Indian tea puts a
fresh strain upon our already overtaxed digestions.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0026" id="i_0026"></a>
<img src="images/i_0026.jpg" width="550" height="428" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PORTERS WAITING FOR WORK.</p>
</div>

<p>In old days the Hankow tea trade was a great
business. Tea-tasters came out from England in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
crowds, arriving in May and going away in July. They
would taste two hundred different teas, not swallowing
the tea, but just savouring its flavour, and smelling it,
and handling the leaf. Then the man who could not
tell the same tea again when he went over the two
hundred the second time was no tea-taster. They
were pale men for the most part, of rather finely strung
susceptibilities, or their palates would not have been
so critical. And they did not care much for games
of chance, they gambled so high in tea, a fortnight's
business easily leading a man to win or lose £20,000.</p>

<p>Ah! the good old days of China tea and silk are
gone. Are there better days yet to come in the new
China that is to take the place of old China, which
is passing away even as we talk about it?</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Inside a Chinese City.</span></h3>

<p>One of the most exciting moments of all my life
in China was when I first found myself shut up within
the walls and barred gates of Wuchang, the provincial
capital of Hupeh, one of the rowdiest provinces of
China. And of the three cities that meet together and
almost join&mdash;Hankow and Wuchang being separated
by the there three-quarter-mile wide Yangtse, and
Hankow and Hanyang separated by the boat-covered
Han&mdash;Wuchang has the reputation of being the most
rowdy. It is there, of course, the Provincial Examinations
are held; and when men assemble in their
thousands away from their families and friends, they are
in all countries apt to be unruly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>Probably, of all the hundreds of foreign tea-men
who visited Hankow, barely one or two had been
across the river to Wuchang. But a missionary, who
was living alone there, and seemed to feel his loneliness,
asked us to go over and spend the night with
him; and with many doubts as to what kind of accommodation
he could give us, and whether we should
be inconveniencing him, we accepted. I have often
been to Wuchang since then. But I remember still
the thrill with which, when I went to bed that night,
I stood at the window and listened to the strange,
unfamiliar sounds from the street beyond the compound,
or garden. There was the night-watchman crying the
hours, and clacking his pieces of bamboo together to
warn evil-doers to keep off. But he did it in a way
I had not yet heard. Then there were such curious
long drawn-out street cries, all unknown, and sounds
of people calling to one another, and the buzz of a
great city. And I suddenly realised, with a choking
sense of emotion, that the gates were shut, and I was
within there with a whole cityful of Chinese so hostile
to foreigners, and especially to foreign women, that it
had not been thought safe to let me walk through
them to the missionary's house. Even the curtain of
my sedan-chair had been drawn down, so that I might
not be seen by any one.</p>

<p>Wuchang has always been specially interesting
to me, because it was my first Chinese city. And
it is so characteristic a one. Every Chinese city
is supposed to be placed on hills representing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
serpent and a tortoise, although the likeness has often
to be helped out by a temple on the tortoise's head,
or a pagoda to connect the serpent's coils. But at
Wuchang the serpent and tortoise are very plainly
visible. Then all Chinese cities are apt to be rude. But
the people at Wuchang are so particularly rude. How
often have not the gentlemen accompanying me, when
in subsequent years I have dared to walk through its
streets, had to separate themselves from me, and to
walk backwards, exhorting the oncoming crowd of
roughs to propriety of behaviour! Curiously enough,
the roughest of Chinese roughs get red and uncomfortable,
when you tell them you fear they have
never learnt politeness, do not observe the rules of
decorum, etc., etc. I learnt it as a patter simply
from hearing it said in my own defence, and have
often raised a blush since then by saying it myself. I
doubt if the same results would be obtained by ever
so eloquent a paraphrase of the fourth commandment
down Whitechapel way. But Chinese, whether they
follow them or not, seem all to have been taught to
hold in respect the dicta of the ancients. To this
day a quotation from Confucius will often settle a moot
point in weighty affairs of State. Would that it were
so among ourselves with a Christian text!</p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">Shanghai Public Gardens.</span></h3>

<p>To those who have just arrived off a long sea
voyage, as to those who from time to time come
down from some roadless, gasless, shopless, but smell-ful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
up-country sojourn, there is one bit of Shanghai
that is exceptionally refreshing and delightsome; and
that is the garden by the river. At night, when
the lamps are lit and mirrored in the water in rows
and garlands of light, when the sea-breeze blows in
freshly, and friends gather in the gardens, I have
even heard it asserted by its greatest detractors,
"Shanghai is as good as any other place by night."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0030" id="i_0030"></a>
<img src="images/i_0030.jpg" width="370" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE BUBBLING WELL.</p>
</div>

<p>But it is in the mornings in winter, or in the before-dinner
hours in summer, when the band plays, that
you must go there, properly to know what the Shanghai
Gardens are like. First and foremost, they are full of
flowers&mdash;flowers with colours and scents. I do not
know how many other people may be thus constituted,
but there are occasions when I would as soon meet
Keats' "Belle Dame Sans Merci" "alone and palely
loitering" as wander through such unmitigated greenery
as the Botanic Gardens at Singapore offer to the passing
traveller, at least in the month of April. Kew Gardens
are all too often depressing after the same fashion;
though there one can always fall back upon the greenhouses
to see</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="o1">"How great Nature truly joys in red and green,</p>

<img src="images/i_0033.jpg" width="564" height="429" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SOOCHOW CREEK, SHANGHAI.</p>
</div>

<p>Hongkong Gardens are very fair to see, resembling
those of Babylon in being hanging gardens, gardens
of terraces. But the way in which the Shanghai
Gardens are fitted in between the Bund and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Soochow Creek, with the much-traversed Garden
Bridge giving something definite to look at, and the
river girdling it all&mdash;the river with its ever-moving
panorama of swift ocean steamers and perky little
steam-launches, and yachts and junks of deeply dyed
sails, and brilliant coloured sanpans, all within a stone's-throw,&mdash;this
situation makes the Shanghai Gardens a
place not easily to be matched for passing away the
after-sunshine hours. But flowers are the Shanghai
Gardens' <i>forte</i>. They should be seen when they are
all abloom with roses; or when lordly tulips dazzle the
eye with their scarlet and gold, till it is fain to seek
relief among those blue and white fairies dancing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
the sunshine&mdash;sweet-scented hyacinths; or when the
chrysanthemums are in season. All these flowers are
seen against a background of glossy-leaved magnolias,
with their pale sweet-scented blossoms, and oleander-trees,
and pomegranates and acacias, all in their different
seasons glorious with rose and scarlet or feathery
pink and white blossoms.</p>

<p>At one season there is a borderful, but full to
overflowing, as those borders almost always are, of the
Japanese <i>Lilium auratum</i>, a large, almost arrogant, white
lily, with a broad band of gold down each petal. A
little while before, people went to the far garden across
the road to see the fly-devouring flower, and inhale
its fetid breath as of dead men's&mdash;not bones, certainly&mdash;and
all uncleanness. Next the water-lilies claimed
their attention, and the poetic rosy lotus flowers, one
of which grew so fast, and with such precision of
rectitude, that its bud forced its way right through the
overshadowing fleshy leaf, and there expanded into a
beautiful blossom at its leisure.</p>

<p>The rarely visited fernery at the end of this garden
well deserves more frequent visits. There you will
find that quaint <i>Asplenium bulbiferum</i>, that drops off
little plants, that happen to be growing about its leaves
like little accidents, and eventually develop into big
plants, that again do likewise. There are also fine
specimens of the Australian <i>Platycerium</i>, which you do
not wonder to find called <i>grande</i>, so solid and woolly-feeling
are its great lumps of leaf. That brown irregular
mark underneath one of the abruptly broken-off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
leaves is not decay, but spores of seed. This, with the
name of <i>Alicorne</i>, something like an inverted porcupine,
reaching out all round hands, some with three fingers,
some with six, sometimes with the fingers tipped underneath
with seed, sometimes not, is said to have arrived
looking for all the world like a withered cabbage. Then
it sprouted and burgeoned; and now it is a thing of joy
for ever, not to be in the least dwarfed or put into
the shade by Australian tree-ferns of really treelike
proportions growing close alongside.</p>

<p>But the fernery has nothing of the charm for me
possessed by the large conservatory. There, after so
many years, I met once again the friends of my
childhood.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">
<p class="i9">"The spirit culls</p>
<p>Unfaded amaranth, when wild it strays</p>
<p>Through the old garden ground of boyish days."</p></div></div>

<p>And there, when first I saw it, were all the many
varieties of fancy geraniums, so seldom seen in England
now, together with heliotropes, and begonias, and
rosellias, and cinerarias, all growing in loveliest confusion,
though not as I remember them, weighing each
other down with their prodigal luxuriance in a garden
border, in far-away Madeira, but intermixed with
Chinese rockwork and ferns, and generally massed so
as to show themselves off to the greatest advantage.
In August that house is full of velvety gloxinias of
richest hues, and again mixed with waxen begonias.
Outside the conservatory are two of those very quaint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Singapore cup-sponges, serving as flower-pots of
Nature's making. And near by, apparently the pride
of the gardener, to judge by its lavish supply of netting,
is an apple-tree, with many apples peeping from underneath
the netting, as yet quite green! But for all their
greenness, one has been carried off by the birds already.
Hence the netting.</p>

<p>But it is in the garden beside the river where the
pleasantest sitting and sauntering is done. No one
puts on best clothes to go there in the morning;
only people who like to go are to be met there&mdash;none
from a sense of duty. There the nurses
love to congregate whilst their children play together,
and add much life and animation to the scene. The
nurses introduce a Chinese element; for otherwise
Chinese, were it even Li Hung-chang himself, are excluded
from the gardens, as now from Australia, solely
because they are Chinese. This never can seem quite
right. The Japanese nurses add an additional element
of picturesqueness, with their dark-coloured, clinging
<i>kimonos</i>, and curious gait, as do also Parsee merchants
with their high, hard hats.</p>

<p>Yet sometimes I have regretted we do not have
more of the flowers of China in Shanghai. What
lovely bursts of blossom one sees at times in the interior
of China! One February I wrote from Chungking:</p>

<p>"Camellias of infinite variety are to be seen already.
It is surprising to notice how many different kinds there
are. Perhaps the loveliest is more like a blush-rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
than a camellia&mdash;delicate coral pink, shading off into
white round the edges of the somewhat crumpled petals.
Since the Chinese seem now to devote no care to them,
nor at all to know how many varieties there are, it is
puzzling to think how they arose."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0037" id="i_0037"></a>

<p class="caption">GUILD GARDEN AT KIANGPEI.<br />
	<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Whilst on March 21st of another year, I wrote
at the time:</p>

<p>"The thermometer is now in the sixties. Our plum-trees
done flowering; orchids coming on victoriously;
tree-tulips and magnolias like big bouquets; and camellias
only slowly waning. Probably nowhere could camellias
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
be seen in greater luxuriance than here, where there
are endless varieties; and a blossom of a peony-camellia,
loose-petalled and very double, on being measured
the other day, revealed a circumference of fifteen and
a quarter inches. Great branches of judas-tree and
pink peach blossom adorn our rooms, together with
a bright-yellow flower that grows in great profusion,
and that used to be called New Zealand flax. From
all this you can fancy how hothouselike our atmosphere
feels just now."</p>

<p>Later in the summer the peonies are the great
pride of the Chinese; whilst the scarlet dragon-boat
flower is, perhaps, the most remarkable of all the
Chinese flowers from being all scarlet together. But
it is useless to try to enumerate; for the highest
authority in Kew Gardens told me once that in no
part of the world was there a more abundant and
varied flora than in the Ichang Gorges, which are also
the land of the butterfly. It is, however, a mistake,
I believe, to think China is called the flowery land
from the number of its flowers, the Chinese word
translated "flowery" meaning also "varicoloured."</p>

<h3>V. <span class="smcap">In the Romantic East at Last!</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Tee San's garden is one of the most fascinating
spots in China, with the bright autumn sunshine
glinting through the pretty bits of trellis-work on
to its fantastic rocks, and zigzag bridges, and pretty
pavilions, and lighting up the truly exquisite specimens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
of chrysanthemums sometimes on show there.
There is the spiky little chrysanthemum, the tiger's
moustache, and huge maroon blossoms fading off into
delicate cream in the centre, and many other uncommon
varieties, each in its appropriate pot, spacious, four-square,
and creamy, apparently just made to be painted,
and each placed at exactly the right elevation by
means of its light wooden stand, sometimes raising the
pot an inch or two, sometimes about eight feet, and
always so slanted, that the flowers are tilted down
towards the spectator, thus showing themselves off in
their entirety. But it is not so much worth while to go
to this garden in order to see the chrysanthemum, as to
admire the infinite variety of Chinese decoration crowded
into what is really a very confined space, but which is
made to appear a garden large enough to lose oneself
in. Rows of bamboo stems of soft blue-green china
relieve the monotony of the walls, with their open
air-spaces in between, as do also various graceful
interlacings of tiles. There are doors of all sorts and
sizes, like a horseshoe, like a pentagon, like a leaf
cut somewhat irregularly down the middle by the leaf
stem, and with outer edge fluted like a leaf. There
are, of course, artificial mounds made out of rockwork,
and grottoes, and quaint lumps of stone, looking as
if they had been masses of molten metal suddenly
hardened in their grotesqueness; also, as a matter of
course, inside the pavilions there are various specimens
of that landscape stone&mdash;dear to the heart of the
Chinaman, and said to come from Yunnan&mdash;framed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and hanging on the walls. There used to be also a
magnificent peacock; a mandarin duck, with its quaint,
bright, decisive colouring; golden pheasants; a scarlet-faced
monkey, and a pale-faced; a little company of
white geese, and another of white rabbits. But
to enumerate the treasures of the garden gives no
idea of the artistic skill with which it has been laid
out; so that every one who sits down in it even in
the most commonplace manner, and even those most
unpicturesque of human beings, Chinese men and
women, immediately becomes an integral part of a
picture.</p>

<p class="caption">PAVILION IN COUNTRY GENTLEMAN'S GARDEN.<br />
	<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There sit two Chinamen, with dark-purple silk outer
jackets and long, glowing blue undergowns. They sit
on each side of a little square black table, with their
long pipes; behind them the sun slants across the
latticed paper window, a branch of Virginia creeper,
already yellow, pushing in through it. It needs not
the addition of the cream-coloured pot with its
chrysanthemums planted well to the front of it, as
they all are, and on the usual slant. Without that bit
of autumn colouring behind them, there is already an
autumn picture,&mdash;men past their prime soothing the
evening of their day in life with the pipe, all nature
attuned with its vivid fast-fleeting sunshine and its
orange-yellow leaves. In another pavilion sits one of
those gorgeous creatures who always recall the braveries
of Sir Walter Scott's descriptions, but who are hardly
now to be seen out of China: his big loose jacket,
of brocaded golden satin, stiff and shimmering: his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
long gown, only less brilliant, of violet satin. A
gnarled and knotted root served there as stand for a
flower-pot, artificial streamlets meandering round the
pavilion. In the pavement was a stork in white, all
formed of little broken bits of tile. The lights and
shades were so entrancing, it was difficult to think of
ever doing anything in these picturesque retreats,
which immediately suggest the Chinaman's ideal&mdash;elegant
leisure&mdash;and furnish most pleasant places to
sit and <i>meditate</i>, as one might say, but in reality
probably idly to watch the sunlight glorify this tint
and soften that.</p>

<p>Without the sunshine it is a different affair. The
patterns in the walls, in the fine pebble pavement,
are still as complex, the triangles in the latter still as
cunningly arranged, the doorways as surprising. There
are still the same China drums of soft blue-green
and green-blue for garden-seats, and great egg-green
vessels for rain-water, as they say "very clear." But
it all looks like a theatrical stage by daylight. Even
the row of changeable roses by the water, which is really
not so clear as it might be, looks uncomfortably pink
beneath a grey rain-sky. Only the hoarfrost-resisting
flower, as the Chinese call the chrysanthemum, is
undimmed, the Chinamen's coats as gay. Whilst
Chinese ladies totter as gracefully&mdash;or ungracefully&mdash;as
before, with highly painted cheeks, gay garments, long
elaborate earrings, beringed and bebraceleted with soft
pure gold unalloyed.</p>

</div>

<p>When we were last there, a dainty-looking Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
dinner was laid out in one of the pavilions; and before
the guests sat down, girls arrived to make merry
with music. For studying Chinese manners and
customs, there could hardly be a more convenient
place. Every one seemed very smart and very friendlily
disposed towards the foreigner. Those who care for
local colour can find it in this garden quite as well as
in the China town; and, after all, when one can find
local colour without local odours, it is a thing to make
note of in China. It is true to get there one must
not only drive down the Fukien Road, with its quaint
dyers' drying-sheds high up against the sky, their
blue draperies streaming from them picturesquely, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
across that very fascinating bridge choked underneath
with highly polished boats, piled with all manner of
merchandise, but also, alas! through a local Covent
Garden, full of colour enough, like its prototype in
London, but, like that, not smell-less. Once arrived,
however, a bewildering sense comes over one of having
left prosaic Shanghai very far away, and of having at
last arrived at a bit of the <i>romantic East</i>!</p>

<p>Of all ways of travel, surely boat-travel is the most
luxurious. For one thing, it is accounted
roughing it; and that means that there is no bother
about toilets: the easiest boots and gloves, the warmest
and most comfortable of clothes, are the appropriate
wear. But that seems to be the whole of the roughing of
it. For naturally each boat-traveller takes care to start
with a favourite chair and a comfortable bed; and it
is his cook's business to provide the most <i>recherché</i> of
little repasts whenever wanted. What else is he there
for? Nor do <i>soufflés</i> and pheasants taste any the worse
because the supply of fresh air is unlimited, and the
cabin as cosy as nothing but a perfectly well-built house,
or a boat floating in water warmer than the surrounding
air, can be. The first time we went up to Chungking,
we had a sleeping-cabin and sitting-cabin, each 9 ft. 4 in.
by 7 ft. 7 in., the former well warmed by a most conveniently
arranged kitchen adjoining, with a plentiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
supply of warm water for our travelling-bath. Thus
our only drawback was that the wind was always
favourable; and whereas our captain had been bound
over to pay us six shillings a day for every day over the
agreed-upon twenty-two between Ichang and Chungking,
we were equally bound to pay him six shillings
a day extra for every day under.</p>

<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>My first trip up the Gorges was, however, very
different. To give its impressions in their freshness, I
will quote from a letter written at the time:</p>

<p class="left65 p2">
"<i>June 20th, 1887.</i></p>

<p>"It depends, I suppose, a good deal upon how much
people like or dislike the journey, whether it is worth
while to come half round the world, and then steam a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
thousand nautical miles into the interior of China, in
order to visit the Gorges of the Yangtse; but we have
just returned from a five-days' trip, and what I have
seen far surpasses my anticipations. Indeed, in all my
travels, I know no country more altogether delightful.
Although it is June, one of the worst seasons for going
there, we have been able to walk about all day long,
and without getting tired too. The air felt fresh, and,
oh! so fragrant with delicious flowers. The feature of
the region, of course, is the precipices. I should guess
the precipices at nothing under two thousand feet, and
perhaps not more than that sheer down, as far as I
have seen: sometimes dolomitic white limestone, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
always reminds me of dead men's bones, sometimes
weathered a rich yellow-brown. The grandeur and
massiveness of the bastions, and towers of rock, and
overhanging pinnacles, and projecting isolated blocks,
or pillars, standing bolt upright in fine relief against
the sky, are not picturesque like the scenery round
Méran, not exciting like some of the Alpine scenery
in Switzerland, but awe-inspiring and sublime.</p>

<p class="caption">ENTRANCE TO YANGTSE GORGES.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"Then the vegetation is enchanting. Nearly every
flower, great big glorious butterfly, and brilliantly
coloured bird is unknown to me; and till people have
walked through a country where this is the case, they
cannot imagine what a zest it adds to an expedition. But
just to tell of those I recognise will show how charming
it is. Fancy bamboos in feathery tufts, and palms,
everywhere, not tall, but very graceful; chestnut-trees
in full flower; plums laden with the rosiest fruit&mdash;but
very bitter we found them; walnut-trees with huge
leaves and nuts; orange-trees; most beautiful, perhaps,
of all, the tallow-tree, rather like the lilac in leaf, but
each leaf set on a very long stalk, so that the slightest
breath sets it quivering, a light bright green in colour,
each shoot tipped at the end with almost scarlet young
leaves, and the whole tree, a tall well-grown tree too,
covered with yellowish tassel-like flowers. Most lovely
is the general effect. And in the autumn, they tell
me, it is even finer, taking the same brilliant tints as
the maple in Canada. I never know if I like this tree
or the soap-tree best. The latter is like an oak in
general effect, but more graceful, and grows quite big.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
But I am keeping the best to the last. Fancy blue
larkspurs, and yellow jasmine, and glorious coloured
oleanders, and begonias, virgin lilies, and yet taller
white lilies, and gardenias, and sunflowers, all growing
<i>wild</i>, and most luxuriantly. I was quite excited when
I first saw waxen-leaved begonias cuddling into the
crevices of a rock by the wayside; and exclaimed
aloud when a turn of the path revealed a whole bank
of dwarf sunflowers, golden in the sun. These, too,
are only the flowers I can name. There are numbers
more, and so fragrant! And among them all enormous
swallow-tailed butterflies, and a very pretty breed of
white goats, with dear little kids, disport themselves.
Grand though the Gorges are, one does not feel
saddened or depressed by them, as I was afraid of being.
It is like seeing a whole troop of graceful loving
grandchildren climbing up some grand old man's knee.</p>

<p>"But the Yangtse certainly does appear a very
wicked river, bristling with rocks and whirlpools, just as
its shores bristle with precipices. We had a very light
boat, and an absurdly large crew&mdash;eight men besides
the head man. And with all their exertions, they
could only get us up against the rushing, whirling
current at the rate of a mile an hour. But the river
ran so fast, and the men worked so hard, and the
shores were so varied, ever opening out some new,
narrow defile, down which a torrent had cut its way&mdash;always
cut quite deep&mdash;that one had no sense at all
of going slowly, but just the contrary. The men had
long bamboos with hooks at the end, and with these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
they would hook on to the rocks, and claw us up
against the current; for we always kept quite close to
the side, so as, as far as possible, to keep out of the
rush of the river, and profit by occasional eddies. Then
at other times they would bound on to the shore,
scampering and giving tongue like a pack of beagles
let loose, and tow the boat along, occasionally bending
almost double in their efforts.</p>

<p>"I thought at first I would walk along the path with
the trackers. Oh the foolish English idea! At times
the trackers bounded along over loose boulders, or over
ledges of rock, where the limestone strata made a fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
smooth surface; but at others they, with their bare feet
and hands well used, had all they could do to find
a footing. During these <i>mauvais pas</i>, or when they
were ferried across in a boat, or waded through the
river, those left on board would claw the rocks, or work
the <i>yulohs</i>, very long and rather unmanageable oars.
The oddest thing was the intense delight the men
seemed to take in their work. But, of course, tracking
our light boat was a very different thing from dragging
a heavily laden junk. Hundreds of men are said to
be lost in these rapids every year. And it really
seems too dangerous work to put men to year in year
out. Think of the tow-line breaking! During the
little time we have been away, we saw one junk
wrecked, and two drifting down-stream unmanageable,
their tow-lines having broken, and nearly all their
men being ashore. And the farthest point we got to
was only fifteen miles from Ichang; so we got back
down-stream in <i>two hours</i>. We did not go farther,
because our captain said it was just then too dangerous
to take our house-boat past the three terrible whirlpools
of Nantor; and, of course, half the pleasure of the
trip was in landing every now and then, and walking
up the wild, narrow glens to different points of view.
One day we walked from ten to seven to the Terrace
of the Sun, where there is a small Taoist temple on
a little ledge of rock just big enough to hold it, at the
top of a mountain quite two thousand feet high, and
with a sheer precipice on one side. Another day we
walked from half-past six till half-past five to the Gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Diamond Mountain, where there is a Buddhist temple
on a slightly larger plateau, with a spring on the
top of the mountain, and a wonderful panoramic view.
It is over a thousand feet higher than the other,
and to get to it you walk along a quite narrow path
with precipices on both sides. Do you realise that
in China there are no railings and no roads, nothing
but narrow paths like English field-paths? I never
really believed it till I came here. And the agriculturists
are always encroaching upon even the narrow
paths there are, planting Indian corn and a few beans
or something, on the chance that the passer-by will
not tread upon them.</p>

<p>"The people are greatly interested in seeing a
European woman. The women flock round, and beg
me to take off my gloves and my hat, that they may
see how my hair is done, and the colour of my hands.
Then some old woman is sure to squeeze my feet, to
see if there is really a foot filling up all those big boots:
for, of course, all the women here have small feet&mdash;that
is, they have them bandaged up; and astonishingly well
they get along upon their hoof-like feet. They are very
friendly, and bring out chairs and benches before their
cottage doors, and beg us to sit down, and offer us tea,
or, if they have not got that ready, hot water. But the
children cry with terror if I touch them or go too near;
and one little boy in a school we went into simply
trembled with fear all the time I stood near him to hear
him read. Sometimes also the dogs run away without
barking, they are so afraid: a great comfort this is, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the barking of the dogs, and the loathsome-looking pigs
at each cottage, and the smells, are the great objection
to going through the often lovely-looking&mdash;from a
distance&mdash;villages. Hoang San Tung, on its terrace
nearly a hundred feet above the river, with all its curved
roofs, looked really like a flight of doves settled down
there, the wings not quite folded yet; and several of the
others are very picturesque from a distance. But the
smells of Ping Shan Pa obliged us to change our
anchorage, there being no reason why we should endure
them. There were fireflies there; but not such glorious
ones as at Shih Pai, where they cast long trails of light
upon the river, and were the most luminous I have ever
seen. I do hope there will be soon a steamer running to
transport people safely and easily to this delightful region.
No boats were able to come down while we were up
the river; and of some machinery for the Viceroy of
Szechuan, that came up here on the previous voyage of
the steamer in which we travelled, we have heard already
that two boatloads are lost, and it is just as likely as
not that the loss of these may make the rest useless.</p>

<p>"Seeing these ranges of mountains, across which
it would, indeed, be difficult to make roads, and
across which there certainly are none, I better realise
how completely the rich and productive province
of Szechuan&mdash;the size of France&mdash;is cut off from the
rest of the world. Yet it will be sad if steamers
introduce an unappreciative crowd to the grand solitudes
of the ravines and precipices, the rocks and rapids of
the Yangtse. Now one can pick one's hands full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
flowers, without thinking one is spoiling any one else's
enjoyment. Now one is away from letters and papers,
from all the 'warstle and the wear o't,' and can enjoy the
health-giving breezes and the grandeur of the scenery
quite undisturbed. It does not require to have lived
perspiring and almost clotheless through the tea-season
at Hankow to enjoy such a trip; but now I begin to
realise more than I did at the time what Hankow is,
with its willow-shaded Bund, and its painted tea-chests
flying along on the shoulders of coolies, and agitated
buyers and sellers, and no 'mountain and water'
beauty, as the Chinese call the beauty of landscape, only
its mirages and its sunsets."</p>

<p class="p2">It is always pleasant to sail before a wind, and
boat-travel taken thus is the delight of travel in essence
divested of all its <i>ennuis</i>, of tiresome fellow-travellers,
dust, steam, rush! Yet there is rushing enough in the
Yangtse Rapids; but rushing of such another sort!
We ran upon a rock our first day, and were not able
to find a leak that night by the flickering light of a
Chinese candle. But next day a bag of damaged rice
showed clearly where it was, and a little tangle of
cotton-yarn with some tallow made it all right. After
that our mast cracked so alarmingly that we shortened
sail; but that also was soon made right, the sole of
an old shoe being nailed over the crack. Old shoes
seem to have <i>lasting</i> power. And we sailed on again
before the favourable wind that had carried us from
Ichang, all through the Yangtse Gorges, in less than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
a week. Was some of our good fortune owing to the
three joss-sticks burning at the stern? They also were
stuck in an old shoe, or rather straw sandal this time.
Perhaps old shoes have a meaning, like so many other
things in China, not understood by people not imbued
from their cradles with the profound truths of <i>Fung shui</i>.</p>

<p>Our voyage was like a dream of childhood realised,
a dream inspired by many readings of Sinbad's marvellous
travels. At Ichang they were making merry
over a disappointed globe-trotter, who had been to
see the Gorges, and come back complaining they were
not perpendicular! Whether he insisted on their
descending perpendicularly to their winter water-line,
or their summer water-line, not seldom sixty feet apart,
report said not. But if he had come on to the Bellows
Gorge, surely even he must have been satisfied. The
great Szechuan Road, the one <i>new</i> road I have seen in
China, is simply hewn out of the face of the apparently
perpendicular rock, so that the cliff arches over it.
There on the southern side are the square holes in the
rock, memorial of Chinese daring, which the celebrated
General Meng Liang caused to be made, so that in
the night he could take his soldiers, on pieces of wood
stuck into these square holes, a rude but strong ladder,
up the face of the cliff, naturally supposed to be inaccessible,
and surprise the enemy, thereby conquering
the kingdom of Shu. There also are the caves, where
men gather saltpetre at dizzy heights, climbing up to
them by paths that make one hot to look at. Farther
on are the iron pillars on one side, and opposite the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
holes in the rock, between which chains were fastened
so as to prevent those of the kingdom to the west of
the Gorges from coming down in their vessels to attack
the men of Hupeh, then the kingdom of Wei. And
here, as we left the gorge, we saw the temple to the
memory of Liu Pei, who was there encamped, and
slain when Meng Liang made his marvellous night
attack. This borderland teems with memories, and
the Chinese do not quickly forget. In Kweichow there
is still a tablet to the wife of Liu Pei, over the well
at the back of what is now the Prefect's official
residence, where she drowned herself when her husband
was slain, nearly two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>But the day we were there was New Year's Eve, and
even our man-servant said it was impossible for me to
go into the city to see it that day; and on the next
day's festival it would be cruel to trouble our good
soldiers to escort us. For we were travelling with that
great luxury, a gunboat, that is also a lifeboat; and
the soldiers, as in all this admirably organised lifeboat
service, were excellent fellows, whether for handling
an oar or for keeping back the crowd. They seemed
positively to delight in carrying the camera, or in
posing for a foreground, evidently admiring their own
clothes very much, and being very wishful to know
if we could read the characters upon their jackets.
But for this gunboat, which sailed faster than our
passenger-boat, and could put us ashore anywhere,
we should have been deprived of nearly all our interesting
walks; for our boat sailed on and on even into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the night. Sailing through the never-ending Witches'
Gorge, ever following <i>White Wings</i> before, a beautifully
appointed junk, that had kept just ahead of us all day,
and seeing our first sunset since we started, soft saffron
in the west, had a very magical effect. It seemed impossible
ever to go back again to one's friends. Why
not sail on for ever, since one had for once discovered
the Ideal Life?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"We knew the merry world was round,</p>
<p>And we might sail for evermore."</p></div></div>

<p>But there were other moments, and moments oft
repeated, when all was excitement and action. Wild
shouts and waving of arms encouraged the steaming
trackers. The water boiled round the bows. The
drum sounded. A man sprang on to an almost
impossible rock&mdash;it is climbed at least twenty times
nearly every day&mdash;and disengaged the tow-line, on
which our lives were depending. The camera was at
full cock! And then a sailor reached in front of it,
and that moment was lost! But the boat hung fire,
and we tried again. At one rapid there were women
tracking&mdash;women with their hoof-like feet and loathly
trousers, giving delicate little pulls, that surely could not
advance the boat much. Then our soldiers were poling
and hooking, with crimson faces and straining arms!
Now we are through that race, and flying along in the
eddy preparatory to the tug-of-war at the next rapid!
The trackers are running ahead like a pack of beagles.
A side-ravine becomes visible, with a grand gateway,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
irresistibly recalling Coleridge's "like cliffs that have
been rent asunder." Then we gaze at caves, squared,
and with fresh-looking ladders hanging from them, and
understand they are places of refuge for the husbandmen
in the houses opposite to retire into should danger
threaten, and that it is not so very long since they were
used. Certainly, they would appear able to stand every
siege but that of hunger.</p>

<p>We passed rocks fluted like organ-pipes, with the
stones that had done the fluting still held captive in
them; rocks fretted almost into lacework by the action
of the water; rocks weathered red, and rocks weathered
grey; and one day we saw a black mass, which we were
told was harder than steel, yet it was gnarled and gnawn
in rings. After passing that black mass, the strata
sloped from east to west, just as on the other side of
the Gorges they sloped from west to east; thus, coming
up-stream, the rocks no longer seemed so menacing
as before.</p>

<p>"But here are the far-famed singing girls of Kweichow,
with reedlike voices, and a man, very pale, with a face
like Dante, for accompanist on a pretty little viol; and
the sound of merry-making increases. Our soldiers have
been cooking their pig's head nearly all day. A
mandarin's boat moored next to us has a regular witches'
cauldron, full of the cock that every one has been
carrying about these last few days, comb, legs, and all,
a pig's head, and several more uncanny-looking bits of
meat. Evidently our trackers also are enjoying a good
feed outside. We have twenty lusty rogues, besides our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
boat's crew. And we are all moored in a tangled mass;
so that there does not seem to be room for even one
boat more to spend its New Year at Kweichow Fu.
There are joss-sticks burning at our cabin door. Joss-sticks
were burnt solemnly over our pig's head in the
gorge in the morning of that day, a cannon solemnly
fired three times, and the cook prostrated himself as he
offered the burnt-offering. Now crackers are going off
all round; and every man who has a chance has asked
me if I do not think Szechuan the most beautiful
country in the world. Even the captain tried to hurry
me in the morning into photographing the entrance into
the first Szechuan gorge. 'Szechuan is beautiful,' he said.
So say all the men with white handkerchiefs bound
round their brows, thus showing their Western origin."</p>

<p>But it was all beautiful, all wild, all grand, after
we entered the Land of Promise through the gate
of the Ichang Gorge. For those who do not love
Nature in her wilder moods this was not the time of
year to travel through the Gorges. They should wait
till spring has garlanded them with flowers like a
Mayfair ballroom, and perfumed the breezes with their
fragrance. There is a certain sameness about the
grandeur of the scenery when seen always under a
leaden sky with a north-easter driving us on. But
for those who admire precipice piled upon precipice,
and rocks rent asunder, every season is the season for
the Gorges, where the Niukan is perhaps the loveliest;
but the Ping Shu Gorge and that of the Fearsome
Pool are certainly the most solemn and impressive;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
while the Witches' Gorge offers the most variety, and
the Ichang Gorge, though perhaps only because it is
best known, ever seems the friendliest, and is certainly
the most fantastic.</p>

<p>All China New Year's Day we wandered through
the ruins of Liu Pei's city. Bits of the wall remain,
and the gateway under the old drum tower; but it is
a little hard to believe these date from <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 200,
although all the people declare they do, and our
man-servant begged that they might be photographed.
We picnicked under a beautiful clump of trees, looking
down upon the grand rock mass, whose being covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
by the river is the signal for the Kweichow authorities
to forbid the passage of junks down-river as too
dangerous. The days of this grand rock mass standing
in mid Yangtse must be numbered, supported as it
is on three pillars; thus there are two arches to be
seen beneath it, when the water is low enough. We
wandered through a lovely temple on the hill, commanding
the most picturesque view we had yet seen
down the last Fearsome Gorge. Unlike most Chinese
temples, this, the first Szechuan temple I had seen,
was really exquisitely kept, clean, and well swept, with
clean, bright windows of many-coloured paper panes.
The priests were polite, the images freshly painted.
We came down through a village, again all clean and
fresh as paint. Every one was in good clothes, of
course, as it was New Year's Day; but it was surprising
to find that even the smartest women were ready to
be photographed, and not at all too frightened to look
into the camera themselves.</p>

<p>We longed to walk along the great Szechuan Road,
completed as far as the Hupeh frontier, sixty miles, at
a reputed cost of £52,000, and really a road, though,
as is usual in Szechuan, it is often long flights of
steps, and several of its crossings over streams looked
doubtful. The Chinese do not make roads sufficiently
often to be good road-makers. Hupeh was to have
continued this road through its gorges to Ichang;
and the great Lo, the Marquis of Carabas of these
parts, had just been up to inspect and chalk O where
the road was to go. If it were ever finished and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
could last, it would rival the Corniche Road for
magnificence of scenery.</p>

<p>But years have past since we first travelled on the
Upper Yangtse, and no steps have yet been taken to
carry the road down-river; the funds intended for this
purpose are said all to have been absorbed in paying
compensation for damage done to foreigners' property
in the riots of one summer. Some day, perhaps, a
railway will be cut out along the river-channel. In
the meantime, my husband has proved the long-doubted
practicability of steaming through the rapids, by himself
taking a little steamer up without any foreign
assistance to help him, only Ningpo engineers, who
knew neither the Szechuan speech nor ways, and a
Szechuan pilot, who had never been on a steamer
before. That voyage will for ever rank among the
most exciting experiences of my life; for all the population
along the river turned out to see the steamer, so
that the cities presented the appearance of having all
their outlines heavily underscored with a blue pencil;
whilst sometimes as many as five Chinese lifeboats
and gunboats, with large pennants and burgees flying,
and occasionally firing their cannon, all wanted her to
tow them at once, since their mission was to protect
her. And as the little steamboat could at the outside go
nine knots an hour, it was, indeed, a business to get her
up the rapids. In one case&mdash;the worst&mdash;she steamed
all she could, and three hundred men, harnessed to
tracking-lines, pulled all they could, till one great
bamboo line snapped. But she got up safely after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
seven minutes, in which one felt as if one's hair turned
white; for if she had once got her head round, she must
have been lost, and every man aboard her. A more
powerful steamer would make nothing of many of the
rapids, and even that worst one at some seasons of
the year is barely noticeable.</p>

<p>To a Chinaman this last is the most interesting place
along the river: for the Emperor of the dead is supposed
to live on the little hill there, as the Emperor of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
living does at Peking; and whenever a Chinaman
dies, all the world over, a letter ought to be written
to Fengtu announcing his death, and not dropped
casually into the post, but solemnly burnt by a Taoist
priest. It is the one place Chinese boatmen regard
with awe, and they object to moving about at night
near Fengtu. Pilgrims come in great numbers to see
the well that is reputed bottomless; and every one
burns a little paper and throws it in. So that when I
saw it the well appeared quite full up to the top. There
was an iron cover over it I longed to photograph;
and as it was quite dark by the well, I asked whether
the soldiers accompanying me might carry it outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
into the daylight and to my surprise no objection was
made to their doing so; and when I set up the camera,
a priest said he would stand beside it with an incense-stick,
as that would look better. There is a great
sword at Fengtu; but we did not learn the legend about
this. The whole hillside was covered with temples, all
crowded with pilgrims; and my husband said if I would
go photographing in Chinese places of pilgrimage, I really
must not expect him to accompany me. But I was new
to China then, and enthusiastic; so four soldiers linked
their arms round me, and in that manner I photographed.

<p>On another voyage
we stopped at Fengtu
for the night as we
were proceeding up-river.
It was when
the chapels and houses
throughout Szechuan
were being burnt down,
and missionaries flying
for their lives, though
no one was killed,
happily. All the people
on the foreshore rushed
down to look at our
boat, brandishing bamboos;
and our servants
said they had to shout
very loud and very energetically that we were not
missionaries in order to save our lives. The principal
official sent down additional soldiers to guard us through
the night. But it was impossible to be frightened.
For that, I think, was really the very hottest night
I have lived through; even lying on the roof of the
boat it was impossible to do anything but gasp.</p>

<p>Beyond Fengtu are the colossal statues of the
philanthropic beancurd-seller and his wife, hewn out
of the living rock, and sitting in caves made in the
rock out of which they are hewn. Beyond them,
again, comes a very pleasant country of farmsteads,
and great shade-trees, and caves in the rock-face, once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
inhabited, it is believed, by the aborigines, who were
there before the Chinese came. But if so, how well
and neatly they are shaped! And why did people
who could square doorways so neatly live in such uncomfortable,
dark places as caves? People all say to
one another that these caves would be very interesting
subjects for study; but so far no one has studied them.</p>

<p>Thus, by many windings, and past great bridges, and
up more rapids, at last we arrive at terrible, long reaches
of rocks; and then at Chungking, the commercial
capital of Szechuan, China's westernmost, and one of
its largest and richest provinces. But Chungking
deserves a chapter to itself, especially as it is the only
Chinese city within whose walls I have lived for years.
Some people call thus living "doing a term of fortress."
A Chinese city is certainly very like a prison.

<p>It is very unusual to make the journey from Ichang
to Chungking by land; but one year in the
spring-time the thought of the dog-roses and the
honeysuckle tempted us, as also the prospect of getting
to our destination a few days earlier; so we crossed
the river at Ichang, and set off over the mountains,
at first all white and glittering with new-fallen snow.
How delicious oranges tasted, when we took alternate
bites of them and crisp mountain snow!</p>

<p>Here and there were large farmsteads, where a
whole clan lived together, thus avoiding the loneliness
of English country life, as also the insecurity. How
it works, and whether there is some natural law by
which no family increases beyond a certain number,
or how it is decided when the moment comes that
some members have to go out into the world to seek
their fortunes, and who it should be, I do not know.
But it is obvious that the Chinese plan leads to a great
deal of pleasant sociability; and as it is always the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
eldest man of the family whose authority is (nominally)
absolute, this must lead to a certain continuity of <i>régime</i>,
very different from what it would be, if, as with us,
a young eldest son every now and then became the
head. It also leads to the erection of very large and
very beautiful homesteads, with generally a beautiful
temple near at hand.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight one day to watch a wedding
party behind us winding up and down the mountainsides,
seven men carrying flags, seven or eight ponies
with red cloth saddles, a red State umbrella carried
by itself, two sedan-chairs, and music, which last
sounded quite pleasantly in the fresh country air. They
were going to fetch the bride, we were told; but our
last sight of them was sad. For, encountering an opium
caravan, one of the wedding party was saucy, and a free
fight ensued, branches being torn off the trees, whilst
all the cavaliers, now mounted, stood huddled together
on a hill, declaring they knew nothing about it instead
of dashing in to the rescue. Meanwhile, one at least of
the wedding party was carried off prostrate and bleeding,
and the opium caravan, with its heavy carrying-poles,
was having it all its own way.</p>

<p>Once we thought we were going to spend the night,
as we always tried to do, at a lonely inn; but there was
a village just beyond it, and the villagers came over,
and were rather troublesome in their curiosity. What
was particularly annoying was that our room was only
partly boarded over at the top with loose, dirty boards;
and when we closed the door, all who could rushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
up ladders into the rafters to look down, or on to
the loose boards above us, staring down at us, and
covering us and our dinner with dust. This had to
be stopped; so we opened the door again. And I got
so tired of the people, I went outside to walk up and
down the road in the moonlight, though certainly we
had had quite enough walking; for our little pony had
lost two shoes, and with so many miles yet to go
had to be spared a good deal. Even in the moonlight,
however, a growing crowd followed me, staring and
giggling, till impatiently I remonstrated. On which a
man stepped forward as spokesman. "We are nothing
but mountain people," he said, "and anything like you
we have never seen before! So we do just want to
look." On this it was impossible not to show oneself
off answering beforehand all the questions I knew they
would otherwise ask, on which they laughed merrily,
quite delighted. But we really wanted to go to bed
some time or other; and so far I had not been able
to wash at all except just my face and hands, which
after a long day across mountains is hardly satisfactory.
So now we tried the expedient of being exceedingly
polite, and wishing them all good-night. After this
had been repeated two or three times, the door being
shut after each good-night, the people dispersed, some
each time taking the hint and going away. But, alas!
it seemed some were going to sleep up above us; and
as there was nothing to prevent their staring down at
us as much as they liked over the ends of the loose
planks, I had to wait till my husband had undressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
comfortably by candle-light, and put the candle out,
and then, as so often before, go to bed in the dark.
Certainly, a man has great advantages in travelling.</p>

<p>Another day one of our coolies had a fight with
one of his substitutes about pay. Every man we pay
always sweats the work out to some one else. The
substitute boxed his ears. He called his substitute's
mother dreadful names. They were both from the
same town, which made it worse. In a second all our
men had thrown down their loads, and were flying
down the hill to join in the fight. As we had just
passed through a little village, I thought, of course, my
husband, who was behind, had been attacked; whilst
he came hurrying up to learn what had been done
to me. Meanwhile, our cook, the real fighting man
of our party, had rushed in to have his innings, just
as ignorant as either of us as to what had really
occurred. Whatever it was, we felt sorry for the poor
substitute, overpowered by the members of our party;
so we at last succeeded in stopping the tail-pulling and
cudgelling, but not before the poor man's face was
all bleeding. Some ten miles farther on we came to
a wayside house, with two venerable-looking Chinamen
sitting in the seat of justice, and the whole party had
to go in. It was decided our coolies were in the
wrong. And I was delighted to hear that such an
insult as they had offered to the man's mother could
not be atoned for by money. They had publicly to
<i>k`otow</i> (bow till they touched the ground with their
foreheads), and to apologise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>At Lichuan occurred our first mobbing, the more
unfortunate as most of our coolies came from there.
Our cook had, as we thought, very imprudently engaged
rooms for us in an inn outside the walls, and evidently
not the best inn. To make it worse, it had an entrance
back and front, and the room assigned to us had
three large windows. So often we had no windows
at all, it seemed particularly unfortunate we should
have three there; for in poured a howling crowd,
and the windows were at once a sea of faces. We
thought it best to bolt the door of the room, setting
our soldier-coolie on guard over it. And the only
thing to do with the windows seemed to be to close
the shutters and wait inside in the darkness, hoping
the crowd would go away when there was nothing
more to see. But there were eyes and fingers at
every crack&mdash;and the room was all cracks&mdash;and the
people coughed to attract our attention, and called to
us to come out; while to judge by the sounds&mdash;but
one can never do this in China&mdash;there seemed to be
fierce fighting between some of them and our coolies.
Presently my husband went out, and tried to reason
with them, telling them if it was only himself they
should be free to come into his room, and see him all
the time; but they knew themselves it was not proper
to look into women's apartments. They seemed too
low and rude a crowd for reasoning; so then he went
to the landlord. And there were one or two furious
onslaughts, and then as many or more men as were
driven out from before came in from behind. And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
landlord said he was powerless. Once they broke the
shutters open, and my husband really frightened them,
rushing out and asking who was trying to steal our
things, and saying he would have the thieves arrested
and taken to the <i>yamen</i>. This was an excellent idea,
and quieted them for a little while. But then it all
began again.</p>

<p>And meanwhile our combative cook, getting ready
our dinner in the midst of all the hurly-burly, was
evidently with difficulty putting a restraint on himself.
We had to light a candle to dine by, and this
let Bedlam loose again. It was our first really hot
day, and we were very tired; but it was evident there
was to be no rest for us that evening. Then, just as
in a very disconsolate state we were going to bed,
between twenty and thirty very smartly dressed women
actually came to call upon us, introduced, as it were, by
a Christian from Wanhsien, who was on a visit to her
relations. She came in, shaking hands very affectionately
at once, and sitting down to talk, as if she were our
dearest friend; whilst she pronounced the people very
bad people, and said she was going away again directly.
But whether she was a real Christian or not we did not
know, although we have since heard all about her, and
that she is a very enthusiastic convert. There were not
enough seats to offer the other women one each. It
was very late, and the noise pretty great; so, after we
had admired their large, hanging, silver earrings, and
they had taken stock of us, as it were, they went away
again, and then&mdash;out with the lights and to bed! But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
there were fingers feeling, feeling at the cracks, and
rude coughs, and noises for hours after that.</p>

<p>Next day we took care to be off before daybreak,
and it was from the open country beyond we saw the
sun rise over Lichuan; but the general appearance of
the town was as if it had long ago set. All the hazy
temples looked dilapidated, and the inhabitants had a
decidedly opium-eating air. And worst of all, there
were no horseshoes to be had. But the little pony
still trotted bravely on with shoes on its two fore feet.
It is rice that specially flourishes round Lichuan, and
the reflections in the paddy-fields were very lovely all
that day. There was a thunderstorm in the evening;
but nothing like so magnificent as what we had a night
or two before, when we took refuge in a schoolhouse,
where the master delighted my husband by his very
educated Chinese.</p>

<p>But then came the question of putting up for the
night again. Every one seemed agitated, and kept
hurrying on in front, as if not wanting to be questioned;
and meanwhile we never stopped! Yet every one was
complaining of not feeling well; and there were the
barrier mountains in front, and nothing now visible
between us and them but one of those large isolated
farmhouses, of which we had seen so many. There
was a network of rice-fields in front of it, the whole
river here being spread out over the fields; and there,
with a screen of gnarled willows before it, the old farmhouse
stood, raised on a little platform, looking down
on the waste of waters. Could it be possible that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
were going to ask hospitality of a private house? It
seemed so, for there was the Boy coming back from
the house to greet us. "Come in quickly, Mississy.
No man must see you. And you no must say anything.
My have say all a mistakey, you no belong woman,
you one man." "But why is that? Why did you say
I was a man?" "This belong old-fashion Chinese
inn&mdash;no can have one woman. The last inn say
no got any room, because no will have one woman.
So my go on very fast, and say you one man. The
people no savee. Only come in quickly now." Would
a stricter moralist have thought it necessary to repudiate
the falsehood, and explain? It was late,
and we were tired, and I went quickly to the inner
room. Then the Boy began to explain further.
According to him, it is in China the height of impropriety
for a man and a woman in travelling to share
the same room. When a Chinese mandarin travels, his
wife goes into the women's quarter with the other
women. Unfortunately, in these inns there was no
women's quarter; so at Lichuan, where it seems the
difficulty had begun, the Boy had said if the landlord
would give me another room I would occupy it, but
there had been none for me. The last inn had refused
us outright; and this being a regular old-fashioned inn
and farmhouse, the Boy had felt quite sure it would
do likewise if it knew. All this was a new idea to us.
And as we saw all the women of the household taking
peeps at us from the window over the buffalo-stable
opposite, we fancied their suspicions had been aroused,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and that after all they knew I was a woman. All
across the mountains there had been a great wondering
as to what I was, and I had often heard the country
people beseeching the coolies to tell them. When I
sat in my chair in my long fur coat, and my husband
rode the pony, they had no doubt at all but that I was
a man, and a mandarin, and he my outrider; and they
used to ask about me in this spirit, and in one village all
stood with bated breath whilst I was carried by. But
with the fur coat, which is greatly worn by mandarins,
my dignity departed, and, on foot or on horseback, I
was altogether an anomaly. The hair seemed to be the
hair of a woman; but, then, the feet were surely the feet
of a man!</p>

<p>Next day, however, our falsehood was revealed; for
it poured pretty well all day: the rain had streamed in
on my husband's bed during the night, and wet most
of his things; one of the coolies was very ill with cold,
the cook pretty sick, my husband ditto; and we settled
to stop the day. And it being so chilly, we were but
too thankful to leave our very draughty, damp rooms,
and to go and sit in one of the family's rooms in the
farmhouse part, where a fire of chaff and shavings on
the floor made a great smoke and a little warmth, and
where all the huge family interviewed us by turns, as
we turned over picture-books. The men of the family
had a most lively game of cards going on, and all our
coolies likewise settled to cards. But some of the family
were reading the Yi King, which, as the head of the
house said, was the foundation of all wisdom, and is one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
of the most difficult of all Chinese classics. This rather
delighted me, just as it did in the boat coming down
to find our coolies and some junk-owners going down
with us all amusing themselves with puzzles I had
always known as Chinese, but never before seen in
China, in especial the complicated cross puzzle made
roughly out of bits of bamboo.</p>

<p class="caption">FREE SCHOOL.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>One day we passed a beautiful free school, built
by some wealthy man for the advantage of his poorer
neighbours in this remote region.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>It was after this began the little dog's triumphant
progress. People had enjoyed seeing him everywhere.
But now, on the borderland between the two provinces
of Hupeh and Szechuan, they really revelled in him.
Mothers brought out their babies, who cooed with
delight; boys danced backwards down the street before
him, clapping their hands. Not the most advanced
opium-smoker but his pallid face relaxed into a smile
at catching sight of our little Jack; and everywhere
we moved to a chorus of "Lion-dog! Lion-dog!" and
general happy smiles. I could not but recall how
in one town, too dirty even to dine in, the crowd had
surveyed us, and at last one boy had said, "Well!
their animals are good-looking," then felt all that
his speech implied, and looked confounded. But we
had again and again heard people admiring the pony's
condition, and saying, "At least foreigners know how
to take care of animals." So my husband was well
satisfied, and I was too, being again asked to sell
little Jack, whom the people thought we must be taking
to market, or why did we take him along the road
with us? A Taoist priest had even come down from
his temple to ask that the dog might be presented to
it. So we felt that at least our animals were appreciated,
whatever we might be.</p>

<p>This was all very well when they did not pelt us.
But they did sometimes. And in one town out of
the crowd came a really well-dressed man, and seized
hold of my foremost chair-coolie&mdash;I was always carried
through the towns&mdash;crying out, "You said it was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
friend of yours!" The coolies offered no resistance.
Before that I had been vainly urging them to carry
me faster; they had appeared to be waiting for something.
But my husband now sprang forward, and seized
the well-dressed man, when, to his surprise, the latter
showed fight. And then all the people on the bank
above us began to pelt, throwing rather better than usual
too. My husband was hit in several places. Our fighting
cook was hit too, but, I believe, flatters himself he gave
quite as good as he got. Even the decidedly non-fighting
Boy's pugnacious instincts were roused. "Only
I thought it would be so dleadful for you, Mississy,"
he said afterwards. So he did not fight. As for me,
I honestly own I never once looked behind, having a
great regard for my eyes when any earth-throwing
begins. And the coolies now hurried me away with a
will, as my husband had dragged off their assailant by
his pigtail, and deposited him in a paddy-field. Several
of the onlookers, being unpleasantly hurt, now told our
party the whole thing had been got up by the well-dressed
man and one or two more, well known in
the place, and regular bullies, who had distributed cash
among the crowd to get us pelted simply out of hatred
to foreigners.</p>

<p>At the next town we were again a little pelted. But
when we got back to the main road, travelling along
once more beside the telegraph-wires, the people were
what we call in China very civil; in any other country
it would be outrageously insolent and ill-mannered.
And before we got there we had to sleep one night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
in one of the most stinking, dirty towns we ever passed
through. We arrived late, so were happily not well
seen; and the people there, having a guilty conscience,
thought that we were officials sent to stop them from
gambling or some other bad practice. So we should
have had a quiet resting-time but for all night long the
most dreadful sort of music going on near at hand. It
was the kind of music that Wagner might have liked for
a <i>motif</i>. But the Boy said it was horribly wicked, and
not even a thing to mention before a lady. As far as I
could make out, it was incantations over a sick person,
not made by any priest, he said, but by the people
themselves, and with witches and dancing. But he
spoke of it with such horror, it seemed wrong to
question him. It had a weird, wicked sound; but it
did not keep us awake. Only, whenever I woke, I
heard it still going on; and it seemed quite in character
with the general look of the place and the sweet sickly
opium smell as we entered the small town. We went
away early next morning through a regular thick fog;
and directly we escaped from the filth of the town, we
were in the prosperous-looking, healthy poppy-fields
again.</p>

<p>For five days we travelled through a perfect flower-show
of poppies, not the wild field-poppy of England,
but like those we have in our gardens, standing up tall
and stately about five feet high. Most were white, a
delicate, fair, frail blossom; others were white, with
fringed petals edged with pink; others altogether pink,
or mauve, or scarlet, or scarlet-and-black, or, perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
best of all, crimson, which, when looked up at on a
bank standing out against the brilliantly blue sky, made
our eyes quite ache with colour-pleasure. But how
sad to hear in a letter from a friend in the Kweichow
Province: "Ten years ago the price of rice per basin
was 7 cash. Now, owing to the poppy taking the place
of what ought to produce food for the people, the
price is 20 cash for the same quantity of rice. And the
people are wretchedly poor and ill-clad, whilst their
poor bodies are wasting away from the constant use
of the drug." One whole day we wandered along a
pleasant path beside a limpid stream, beautiful, tall,
bending bamboos making a refreshing breeze over our
heads, with their cool green feathery foliage. If all
the world could be traversed by paths like that, who
would ever travel but on foot? But in the end we
arrived at beautiful Chungking in a boat, as is usual
with this river-encircled city.

<p>Chungking has been so fully described in my
husband's volume <i>Through the Yangtse Gorges</i>,
I will not here enter upon a description of it further
than to say it is situated, like Quebec, at the junction
of two rivers. It a little recalls Edinburgh; it is about
the size of Lyons; has walls all round it; and its gates
are shut at sunset, all but two, which remain open an
hour or two longer, except when the country is in
commotion. It is built upon a rock; and as the summer
progresses all the rock warms up, till the heat is very
great indeed. The streets are mostly covered over,
both as a protection against the sun, and the rain, which
is very frequent. There is thus no possibility of fresh
air getting into its streets, short of a gale occurring;
and there is only very rarely any wind, as is shown by
the large shade-trees on the tops of the hills, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
awnings to keep the sun off the houses, which are
supported on bamboos, and which in this windless
region are taken up even over the roofs of the houses.</p>

<p class="caption">CHUNGKING, COMMERCIAL CAPITAL OF WESTERN CHINA.</p>
</div>

<p>Now all the missions have built European houses;
but a little while ago all foreigners lived in Chinese
houses within the walls of the city. To describe one:
You enter off a dirty alley by a large gateway, the only
opening in the lofty fire-proof walls that surround the
whole property; for fire is the great danger of a Chinese
city, and a whole quarter of Chungking has been
burnt down since we have lived there. You pass into
a sort of courtyard; from that you proceed by a long
passage to another gateway, thence into a courtyard
ornamentally laid out with pots and flowers. The house
door opens from this; and entering by it, you find yourself
in the lofty entrance hall, used by Europeans as
a dining-room. Passing through an ornamental screen
with open doorways, over which hang portières, you find
yourself in a sitting-room, of which one wall and two
half-walls consist of paper windows, with occasional panes
of glass. On either side of these two principal rooms
are long narrow ones, only thirteen feet wide, which
for convenience their English occupants had divided
into two, the end wall being in both cases again paper
windows with occasional glass. Paper ceilings had been
put in to prevent the dust falling through from the
tiled roof above; but the sun would shine through this
as well as the tiles quite brilliantly at times. None of
the partition doors had handles or latches, and the
outer walls, as well as the inside partitions, were all alike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
of thin planks of wood, not overlapping, and which
would shrink in dry weather so as to leave quite large
openings between them. It will thus be realised that,
whatever was the temperature outside the house, the
same was the temperature inside, with the additional
disadvantage of draughts on rainy, wintry days; and in
winter it generally rains in Chungking. Europeans
always took care to secure wooden floors for themselves;
but these floors were not uncommonly rotting
away under their feet. And picturesque though the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
houses are, with their lofty roofs, their solid wooden
pillars, black rafters, and white plaster, their highly
decorated exteriors, little pictures in black and white
under the eaves, richly carved and heavily gilded ends
to the beams, etc., it became increasingly evident each
year that Europeans could not hope for health in them.
Chinese in winter wear heavily wadded and fur-lined
clothes, in which it is impossible to take exercise, and
inside of which they loll about in a semi-comatose
condition, much as if in bed.</p>

<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The streets, although wide for a Chinese city, are
very narrow in comparison with English streets, being
only eight feet at the widest, and extraordinarily crowded.
Passing through them is a continual pushing through
a crowd of foot-passengers; of sedan-chairs, carried
by coolies, with sometimes one or two men running
before to clear the way, and if it be necessary beat
back the crowd; of mules, donkeys, or ponies, with loads;
and of numbers of carrying-coolies, a bamboo across
their shoulders, and from either end a basket hanging
by strings. Everything that can be done in the streets
is done in them: pedlars go by with great quantities
of goods for sale; men are mending broken china with
little rivets after a fashion in which the Chinese are
great experts; here is a barber shaving a man's head,
there are two women menders, on little stools very
neatly dressed, pursuing their avocation; here is a man
working at an embroidery-frame, there a cobbler mending
shoes; here some pigs, there some chickens; here
a baby in a hen-coop, there a pussy-cat tied to a shop-counter;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
and in the evenings street preachers, in the
afternoons vast crowds pouring out from theatres. At
night, in going out to dinner we used always to pass at
least three street preachers. These men wear official
caps, and are as a rule, I believe, reading or expounding
the Sacred Edicts. There is always a little crowd
listening, though often a very small one. In the better
streets every attention is paid to decency; in the lesser
streets none is apparent. At the street corners there are
often large tanks full of water, as a precaution against
fire. These are invariably grown over with weed. A
vast army of coolies is every day going down the
steep flights of steps to the river to bring water, which
drips from the buckets as it is carried along. Another
army is carrying out the sewage of the city to be used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
as manure. A very soft coal is used for fuel; and
baskets of coal are constantly being carried in, two
dangling from a pole across a coolie's shoulders. The
coal-dust, and the smoke, and the drippings, and the
bustling crowd, all make the streets rather an unpleasant
place to walk in. Yet, although every one told me it
was impossible for an English lady to walk in them,
I felt it was impossible for me to live in Chungking
unless I did; for in summer no one could walk out till
sunset, and then the gates are closed; so after showing
myself about as much as I could in a sedan-chair with
the curtains up&mdash;unlike the other ladies, who all kept
theirs down in those days&mdash;I determined to attempt
a walk, with my sedan-chair, of course, following behind
to show I had some claim to respectability.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0095" id="i_0095"></a>
<img src="images/i_0095.jpg" width="504" height="383" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MORNING TOILETTE.</p>
</div>

<p>In a few minutes two or three hundred men and
boys were following me. As long as they kept behind
and did not press upon me, it did not so much matter;
but the boys have a knack of clattering past, and
then turning round to stare into one's face in the most
insulting and annoying manner. And I felt I could
not go back home with all this rabble following, as
of course they would all try to press into our house
after me, and then there would probably be a row.
So I turned into the official residence of the principal
magistrate of the city, hoping that the guardians of his
gate might stop both me and my following, as I supposed
it would be their duty to do, and then I might
somehow detach myself. Into the first courtyard every
one has a right to go; but as we proceeded farther,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
soldiers came up and remonstrated with me. "Well,
do your duty&mdash;shut us out," I said. "Do shut the people
out, and then I won't go any farther." But they did
not do their duty; and so, not seeing what else to do,
I set up the camera and photographed the crowd and
the soldiers, not doing their duty and turning them
out. After that I got into my chair; and the people,
curiously enough, satisfied that that was what I had
come out for, dispersed, and I arrived at home unattended.
But many a walk since then have I taken
through these same streets; and the people have got
so accustomed to the sight of me, that they now do
not turn round to look.</p>

<p>One of the most fatiguing things about Chinese
life is the presents. Whatever you do, you ought to
take or send a present. Every lady who goes out to
dinner takes a present to the hostess; and at a certain
period of the dinner all sorts of things are done up
in a heterogeneous mass for each guest to take home
to her children, if she has any; whilst the hostess
pays all her friends' chair-coolies, and the guest tips
the hostess's servants, especially the cook, who has a
great title of honour in China. If ladies care to call,
they generally bring presents too, rolled up in a handsome,
coloured handkerchief. The most curious present
I have received at a dinner party was a white cat,
that could hardly see out of its eyes. The general
present seems to be sponge-cakes or fruit.</p>

<p class="caption">OUTSIDE GOVERNOR'S RESIDENCE IN CHUNGKING.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Cats are very much prized in a Chinese city,
because of the fierce depredations of the rats; and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Chungking cats are always kept prisoners, and only
occasionally let loose at night. It is sad to see the
poor things tied up; and we have never been able to
make up our minds to keep our cats thus chained.
The consequence is they are always stolen, and have a
miserable life of it, tied up, and probably far less
well fed than they would have been with us. Fowls
and pigs are both kept in Chinese cities, and the
eggs get a most unpleasing flavour from the vile
nature of the places where the poor hens have to
lay them.</p>

<p>When I pay a call on a lady, my chair has to be
carried over the thresholds of the various courtyards,
and set down quite close to the guest-room, where the
lady of the house receives, so that I may at once step
out of the chair into the house. A woman-servant,
almost certainly a slave, comes to offer her shoulder as
a help to my tottering footsteps, and I am conducted
into the guest-room, round the walls of which there
are little tables, large carved wooden chairs with
straight backs being placed one on either side of each
table against the wall. The ladies bow after the
Chinese lady's fashion, placing the right hand on the
top of the left against the chest, and moving the right
hand slowly up and down; the servants are ordered
to bring tea; and then conversation commences. It
is never very interesting. The floors are as often as
not made of hard mud; the walls whitewashed, with
long-shaped pictures, or <i>kakemonos</i>, hanging upon them,
often with epigrammatic sentences in the decorative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Chinese character. At one end of the room is the
altarlike table, above which is the ancestral tablet, and
on it stand generally candlesticks made of pewter,
flower-vases, an incense-burner, and a small vase for
incense-sticks. Embroideries are not hung over this
table and on the backs of the chairs, unless it is the
Chinese New Year time or a dinner party. When the
tea is brought, little sugared cakes accompany it; and men
say the etiquette is to go away directly you have sipped
the tea. But I have never known ladies observe this
etiquette. Indeed, the chief fault in Chinese visits is
that they are interminable. As no one exerts herself to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
talk more than she feels inclined, there is, indeed, no
reason why they should ever come to an end.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0101" id="i_0101"></a>
<img src="images/i_0101.jpg" width="550" height="438" alt="" />
<p class="caption">COUNTRY HOUSE NEAR KIUKIANG.</p>
</div>

<p>Chinese ladies appear very affectionate, and are very
caressing. Whether they really do like me or not, they
almost always succeed in making me think they do;
and I think other European ladies would say the same.
But as to whether the holding one's hand and occasionally
stroking it means anything, I really do not know.
They never have shown me anything, unless they
wanted to sell it, except their children. At an artist's
house pictures are brought out; but they are all carefully
rolled up and put away again. And at other houses
embroideries worked by various brides of the family
have been shown me; but this was in order to see if
I would buy them. It must be recollected that to the
Chinese a foreign woman's tight-fitting dress showing
her figure is very indecent. It also seems to them very
shocking for a lady to go about unattended by a woman;
and for a woman to stand up firmly on her feet and
walk on them like a man seems far more indelicate than
it does in England to wear so-called rationals. Thus
there are great difficulties to be got over at first. They
are, indeed, greatly concerned about our indecency; for
they have heard no European woman wears trousers,
and their first great anxiety is to examine under our
petticoats, and see whether this is really true. Trousers
are the one essential garment to a woman in China.
Sometimes they ask, "Do you really eat with your
waist girt in like that? How do you manage then?"
But this they have only once had the opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of asking of me; for knowing it to be considered
objectionable, I avoid wearing anything that shows the
figure, in China, as far as I can. After all, tea-jackets
admit of many pretty varieties. A European man's
dress is, of course, a still greater scandal; and to
Chinese, the only explanation of it is that the poor
fellow had not enough cloth to cover himself properly.
After spending any length of time amongst Orientals,
I think every one must feel that our European dress
is lacking in grace and elegance.</p>

<p>It takes longer to get a letter the fifteen hundred
miles from Shanghai to Chungking than it does to
get a letter the thirteen thousand from England to
Shanghai. Freight of goods is a great deal higher;
indeed, a ton of goods costs £6 from Shanghai to
Chungking, and £36 to get it to Talifu in Yunnan.
Once I wrote to England on Christmas Eve for
stockings, saying I was in such need of them I
should like to have them sent out by post; and yet I
never received those stockings till the following spring
year. In an ordinary way, with good luck, you ought to
get an answer to a letter from England in four months;
therefore, if you keep up a very animated correspondence
with an English friend, always answering every
letter directly you receive it, you write three letters a
year. And curiously enough, whatever you may do
at Chungking, the sense of its being so very far away
deters other people from writing to you. Charles Lamb
has written a beautiful Elia essay upon this. He
explains it by the suggestion that the writer, thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of the great distance the letter has to travel, fancies it
growing tired. Anyhow, the result tends to heighten
the sense of isolation, which is perhaps nowhere so
much felt as among Chinese. Whether it is their
expressionlessness, their want of sympathy, or the whole
character of their civilisation being so different from
ours, very few Europeans can spend more than a year
amongst Chinese without suffering from it. Some go
mad with it, and all are accused of growing odd. There
is no doubt that most of us become somewhat self-centred
and unduly impressed with the importance of
our own affairs; but the depression that often overtakes
people, women especially, is sadder to witness. In
sending out missionaries, this is a point that ought to
be specially considered: Have they enough strength of
character to continue the work of an apostle without any
outside spiritual or inspiriting influences whatsoever? It
is not long since a man I had thought so ardent said to
me: "I am going away; and I never mean to return.
I cannot go on giving out, and having no spiritual help
myself." Yet, just because they are trying to live for
others, missionaries stand this trial best. I have known
other men who from the moment they arrived in a
Chinese town found no pleasure but in counting the
days. "One more spent here!&mdash;one less to spend!"
and this without even the least idea of when they would
go away.</p>

<p>To Chinese children I always think life in a Chinese
city must be very pleasant. There are the great
festivals: the Chinese New Year, with all its countless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
crackers; the Dragon Boat Festival, when each district
of the city mans a boat shaped like a dragon, and all
paddle like mad, naked to the waist, and with a strange
shout that must be very dear to children. Then there
are the visits to the graves, when all the family goes out
into the country together; and the long processions,
when the officials are carried through the city in open
chairs and long fur gowns, hundreds of umbrellas of
gay colours going before them, and their retainers also
riding in pairs and in fur coats of inferior quality. All
the beggar-children of the city have a high day then.
With fancy dress of various sorts over their rags, they
walk or ride or are carried round the city, sometimes
as living pictures, sometimes representing conquered
aborigines, sometimes even Englishmen in short square
coats and tight trousers. In the spring-time a procession
goes out to meet the spring, and sacrifice an
ox in the river-bed in its honour; and, strangely enough,
the day in February on which this is done is always
the most genial springlike day, though after it is over
winter sets in with renewed severity. At other times
it is the image of the fire-god that is carried round,
to show him the buildings he is honoured to protect.
Then, again, one evening there will be about four miles
of little lanterns sent floating down the great river in
honour of the dead. Or there will be the baking of
the glutinous rice-cakes, accompanied by many curious
ceremonials. And in it all the child takes his part; and
his elders are very kind to him, and never bother him
with cleaning up or putting on clothes to go out. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
strips to the waist or beyond it in summer; then, as
the winter comes on, puts on ever another and another
garment, till he becomes as broad as he is long. At
night-time, perhaps, he takes off some clothes; but they
are all the same shape, all quite loose and easy. Then
he never need be afraid of breaking anything or spoiling
anything; for most things are put away, and Chinese
things are not like European: the shining black polished
table, for instance, can have a hot kettle stood upon it,
and be none the worse. No one ever tells the Chinese
child to hold himself up, or not to talk so loud, or
to keep still; so he shouts and wriggles to his heart's
content. And European children grow like him in
this respect; and when readmitted to European houses,
their feet are for ever rubbing about, and their hands
fidgeting with something, which spoils, as European
things will spoil.</p>

<p>Although there is so much rain in the west of China,
and when it does not rain the air is generally damp to
saturation-point, yet sometimes there is a long continuance
of summer heat. One year, although according
to the Chinese calendar the ending of the great heat had
come&mdash;and, indeed, also the beginning of autumn, when,
if it does not rain, according to the saying, no rain
will fall for forty days&mdash;yet no rain fell, no thunder
cooled the air. The ground was growing harder
and harder, and the hills acquiring the yellow
baked look so familiar down-river, but so unusual in
Chungking.</p>

<p>The south gate was not closed. The idea is, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
heat comes in from the south; therefore, when it is
too hot, the south gate is always closed. There was,
however, too much traffic through it. But no meat,
fowls, nor eggs were allowed to go in thereat, and
the various cooks and coolies sent in on foraging
excursions from the hills returned disconsolate. If
any one sold anything, it was with the air of a thief,
one man reported. Europeans were beginning to consider
what they would have to eat, if this prohibition
were strictly enforced. Already for two days the
killing of pigs had been forbidden. Outside most
houses in the city stood a tub of water ready to be
dashed over the too dry woodwork. Already report
had been busy destroying the thriving and populous
city of Luchou higher up the river by fire; but on a
telegram being sent to inquire, the report was found to
have arisen in people's own heated imaginations. The
danger of fire is ever with us in China, with our
wooden houses all dry as tinder and our closely
packed opium-smoking population. As to the amount of
dirt then concentrated in Chungking, it was shocking
to think of; for the place had not been washed out
for six weeks.</p>

<p>There is an old saying that drought never wrought
England harm. One has the same feeling in Szechuan;
and when day by day the beautiful red-golden glow
spreads along the range beyond range of mountain-tops,
and the sun arises upon a cloudy sky, we cannot help
thinking these clouds must gradually get lower, and
rain come to cool the air and refresh the country. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
night, as we see the lightning flash on the clouds south
and west of us, and feel the cool breath of distant
rain, we again think it must be on its way. Only
during the long hot day there seems no prospect of
it; the clouds reveal themselves as summer clouds;
the sun shines; and we think how hot it must be in
that southern region from which the hot wind comes
to us, and wonder whether it is in Tongking, or where,
there has been a tremendous rainfall. Has there been
somewhere some great convulsion of nature? or is it
again all a case of sun-spots? When it is so very
hot, what can one think of but the weather?</p>

<p>I never saw the thermometer mark higher than
120° Fahr. in our sitting-room; but then, when it got to
that, I always went down into the cellar, and did not
come out again till evening. The Chinese have cool,
dark places dug out of the rock into which they retire
to <i>schwa</i>, i.e. enjoy themselves. All the guild gardens
round Chungking are provided with such places. The
worst of them is, there is no air in them. But, then,
every one has a fan. Even the man heavily laden like
a beast of burden has his fan stuck into his waist-belt;
the soldier has his fan. It is not a luxury, but
a necessary of life, in a Chinese city in summer.</p>

<p>In the spring-time what can be prettier than the
environs of a Chinese city? The rape-fields are all
fragrant with their bright-yellow flowers; whilst the
still sweeter scent of the bean blossom makes it a real
pleasure to walk along the narrow paths by the river-side.
Every one is walking about with a bunch of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
roseate peach blossom, and the tangles of trees in the
gardens are all flowering and all scented. Then a little
later the poppy-fields become gorgeous almost up to
the city gates, only shortly afterwards to give out a
poisonous exhalation most irritating to the mucous
membrane. After that everything trembles and glitters
with the scorching sunshine, all the leaves droop, gigantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
sun-flowers are running to
seed, and the large pink-and-white
lily flowers of the
lotus float upon the waterside.
Every woman has a
white gardenia flower stuck
on the left side of her
glossy black hair. And all
outside the city is inspiriting,
when the sun shines and
the blue rivers laugh back
at the blue sky. But inside
the city it is still all dark and
dank, and all is pervaded by
a sickly sweet odour, the
emanation from the opium-pipe;
while the lean ribs and
yellow faces of the opium-smokers
controvert without
the need of words all the
scientific assertions about
the non-volatilisation of the
opium poison. With opium-dens
all over the place,
with exquisite opium-pipes
and all the coquetries of
opium-trays and other accessories in the houses of the
rich, how is it that we all give warning to a servant
when we hear that he has taken to opium? How
is it that the treasure on a journey is never confided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
to a coolie who smokes? How is it that every man
shrinks with horror from the idea of an opium-smoking
wife? And this in a land in which all important
business dealings are concluded over the opium-couch,
where, indeed, alone, with heads close together, is
privacy to be obtained, and in which all important
military posts are confided to opium-smokers, not to
speak of most of the important civil offices!</p>

<p>There is, it is true, an immense difference between
the man who smokes and him who has the <i>yin</i>, or
craving, that must at all costs be satisfied; just as there
is at home between the moderate drinker and the
dipsomaniac. But in China people refuse to employ the
moderate smoker to sweep out their rooms for them.
Yet they will confide an army to him! These, however,
are secrets of State, not to be got to the bottom
of simply by life in a Chinese city.</p>

<p>There is one other matter, however, I must touch
upon&mdash;the all-pervading babble, row I had almost called
it, of the boys in the schools, here, there, and everywhere,
so that it is almost impossible to get out of
earshot of them, all at the top of their boy voices
shouting out the classics, as they painstakingly day
after day and year after year commit them to memory.
With the sickly sweet smell of the opium, and to the
sound of the vast ear-drum-splitting army of China's
schoolboys, all must for ever associate life in a Chinese
city. And through it all, and up and down its flights
of stairs, painfully hobbles the Chinese girl-child, the
most ungraceful figure of all girl-children,&mdash;poor little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
mutilated one, with her long stick and dreadful dark
lines under her sad young eyes! Whatever the men
may be, certainly the little girls of China are brought
up as Spartans even never were, and those who survive
show it by their powers of endurance.

<p>As an illustration of the position of Europeans
up-country, I will relate very briefly the trivial
events of two days. First I must say that nearly every
woman in the place was ill&mdash;some very seriously so; and
as I thought I was not well either, on hearing that my
husband and another gentleman, who had gone for a
cure to the sulphur baths about thirteen miles from
Chungking, found the people quiet, I decided I would
join my husband when his friend left him. The villagers,
not the priests, objected to my sleeping in the airy
temple, where the gentlemen had been allowed to put
up their beds, amongst all the gilded images; so my
bed and I and a servant moved down to the inn, where
some twelve or fifteen persons assisted at the remaking
of the bed in an already sufficiently stuffy room&mdash;although,
happily, most of the dirty paper was gone
from its one window&mdash;and being accustomed to the ways
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
up-country, I slept just as well in that filthy inn room
as I could have anywhere.</p>

<p>Next day, with a chair and a variety of coolies
and boys, we took three photographs, and spent the
morning under the shade of a magnificent banyan-tree
in a lonely valley, stuck over with palms as a
pincushion is with pins. The baths were so very hot,
my husband thought he would refresh himself by a
swim in the limpid stream that runs with many a beautiful
cascade down the extremely picturesque limestone
valley of the Wentang. Meanwhile, though it was
extremely hot, so that it was an effort to move, especially
after the hot sulphur baths, yet, being like Frederick
"a slave to duty," I took a chair and five coolies to
go a hundred yards across the bridge and photograph
that and the hot springs from the opposite side.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as is so often the case, about twenty
little laughing boys ran whooping along with me, joined
as they went by some older people. This is so usual,
I was only bored by it as I got out, and, studying
the scene first from one point and then from another,
was telling the coolies to bring the camera to a grassy
plot from which the best view of the arches of the
bridge and the deep pool and the hills behind could
be obtained, when some agriculturists rushed forward,
one lusty fellow violently threatening me with a stone,
and at once snatching my alpenstock out of my hand.
I trust I did not move an eyelid, certainly I did not
budge a step, as I said: "Is this your land? If so,
you are master here; and if you do not wish me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
photograph, I certainly will not. But I am doing no
harm." The head coolie did his best to explain what
other photographs I had taken, and that photographing
did not spoil crops. But the agriculturist first listened,
and then resumed his violence. Probably he was
excited by the prospect of all my following capering
across an infinitesimal bit of cultivation that he had
squeezed out of the rocks below. He told them not to
do so. The coolie told them not to. They did not.
But he continued to be violent. The best plan seemed
to be to get into the chair and secure the camera; and
as all the crowd began to get uproarious, I thought I
would be carried quickly away instead of back through
them. A very steep hill must, I thought, choke my
following off. But it did not. And I had either to return
with them to the town, in which case there was sure
to be a row, or go to a distance of about two hours up
one side of the stream by a very pretty path, and back
again the other side by one of the most lonely of wild
mountain roads. I had done it all before, having enjoyed
all these scenes two years ago, when there was no
thought of violence. However, my following kept with
me, and grew. So I tried my old plan, the only one
I have ever found effectual with a Chinese crowd, and,
getting out of the chair, standing quite still, looked
solemnly and sadly at first one, then another, till he
wished the ground would cover him and retired. I
fancy glasses heighten the effect. Anyway, they all
sat down, each one hiding behind the other as far as
he could.

<p class="caption">MARKET STREET OUTSIDE CITY.</p>
</div>

<p>We went on, and thus came near a very large
Chinese house and garden, with a queer tale of a dead
magician, where we had been hospitably entertained
two years before. The people knew he had been a
magician, because he used to disappear every day at
a certain hour; and some one peeped through a crack
one day, and saw him actually in a cold-water bath
like a fish. I thought it would be a pleasure to
visit the garden once more; but again a man shouting
and gesticulating, this time armed with one of those
heavy hoes they use in digging, which he brandished
across my face! It seemed his master, who had entertained
us, was dead, and this rustic would have no
photography. It was a long way back by the other
side of the river, so that it was quite dark when we
got back to the little town. This perhaps was just
as well.</p>

<p>Next day by daybreak we set off for Chungking.
After five pretty but surely very long miles, we came
to a market town; and, alas! it was market day. The
coolies were desired to carry me to the best inn, and
take me in quickly. Of course, it was necessary for
them to get some refreshment, or we should not have
stopped. I walked to the farthest end of the huge
room set out with tables; but the agitated innkeeper
asked me to come into a bedroom beyond, there
were so many people. He banged to the doors, and
then there began a hurly-burly, everybody wanting to
get a sight of me. He begged me to go into a bedroom
beyond down a steep ladder, and again bolted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the doors. This room was even nastier than the
first,&mdash;four beds with straw, no chair, and a frowsy
table. It was so good of him to tell me it was clean,
for I should never have imagined it otherwise. A
young gentleman occupying an adjacent bedroom began
to look furious at the noise and the barring of the
doors. With a haughty air he unbarred them. I
did not wonder he did not like it. I did not either.
Who wants to be barricaded in a chairless, windowless
bedroom on a hot day?</p>

<p>It was a great relief when my husband quickly
followed me, passing in through the files of people
gazing at closed doors. But no one could serve us
with tea, and the people got all round the room trying
to peep in through the cracks, as also to pull down
one partition. Meantime, there was what Germans
call "scandal." At last our coolies had fed, the chairs
were ready, and, handsomely escorted, we passed out
through people in rows, to find the street outside and
all the houses one living mass of human heads all
staring. It was easy enough to get into the chair,
but the coolies had to fight the crowd back to get
the poles on their shoulders; and so, amongst a chorus
of the usual soft Szechuan imprecations, we departed.
I have composed a song with it for the chorus; it
sounds pretty, but I am told it is untranslatable. One
moves everywhere to the music of it.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OLDEST OFFICIAL IN THE PROVINCE OF SZECHUAN.<br />
<i>Lent by Mr. Willett.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Probably our coolies' temper was not improved by
the hustling. For, a mile and a half farther on, when
we had to take a boat, and after the usual amount of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
wearisome bargaining had secured one, they greeted
a boatman, who kept us waiting some time till he
appeared with the long pole iron-spiked used for poling
the boat off rocks, with the usual Szechuan oath, and
a tag, that seemed to me harmless enough. But the
boatman, a tall, fine-looking man, said he could not
stand that, and immediately rolled one of our coolies
in the mud. In a minute all our gang together were
on him. Vainly did my husband call them off. At last,
however, somehow they got into the boat again and
pushed off; and the great thing seemed to be to get
away, for there was the infuriated giant with his pole
and his friends wildly springing from rock to rock to
get at us. But whether because we were caught in a
whirlpool, or whether the owner of the boat steered it
back, or what, there we were presently drifting round
to the now assembled village, all shrieking, and many
armed with carrying-poles. The only thing to do
seemed to be to sit quite still; but I felt the more
frightened, because it was impossible even to speak to
my husband for the uproar. And, indeed, for a time
mine was the silence of despair; for a tap from one
of those carrying-poles, and all would be over for me,
whilst the river was running so strongly, to get into
that would be certain drowning. The fight, however,
was, after all, not so bad; for a village elder appeared,
and again and again collared the infuriated giant and
forced him off the boat. Meanwhile, every one shouted,
and the expressions of the crowd were something
horrible to see, especially those of some women, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
faces seemed to have passed away and left nothing
behind but concentrated rage. One of these viragoes
actually came on to our boat, and was proceeding herself
to capture the one of our coolies who may be said to
have begun it all by his inconsiderate language. This
first gave me courage. If she, a thin, weak-looking
woman, could venture into the midst of these angry
men, she must know they were not really so violent
as they appeared, I argued. But she also was forced
away by the elder. Then two spitfires of boys became
prominent, shrieking menaces and brandishing their
arms.</p>

<p>At last there was a sufficient lull for my husband
and the village elder to exchange names, smiles, and
courtesies, which they did with as much ceremony and
as pleasant expressions as if they had just met in a
London drawing-room. After a second row, the elder
asked us to get into another boat. This we did. It
was much smaller; but a man with cucumbers, who
had been bent on getting a passage for nothing in
our boat, and had been ejected, managed now to
establish himself in it along with us. He was the only
one who seemed to have gained anything out of the
whole transaction. We had grown too weak to eject
him again. We had been delayed a whole hour in a
burning sun; and thanks to this, and the delay in the
market town, reached Chungking about noon, both
suffering from slight sunstroke.</p>

<p>Each time the mail came in one winter we expected
to hear that some Shanghai Volunteers had gone on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
little expedition, and somehow managed to knock up
against the prison in which the poor people were shut
up whose sole crime was having sold an estate near
Kiukiang to an Englishman. In the old days the young
men of Kiukiang once had a picnic, to which they
invited blue-jackets from a man-of-war in port; and that
picnic gained for the place undisputed possession of
the bungalow where so many Europeans have since
then regained health. There was no fighting, no threat
of fighting, no ultimatum; they just went and did what
had to be done themselves, their friends the blue-jackets
helping them. But by the last accounts Kiukiang
was occupied with private theatricals, whilst the men
who sold their land to Englishmen&mdash;nothing more, only
had dealings with Englishmen&mdash;were still in prison.
Whilst that is so, whilst the man who allowed Christian
services to be held in his house near Wenchow is
persecuted, whilst our beautiful hills are all studded
round with upright slabs of stone forbidding Europeans
to build upon any of the sites sold to them, how can
we expect as Englishmen to be respected in China?
One American and one Englishman had even begun
building upon these hills. There were the projected
sites of the houses, with the hewn stones lying round
and the foundations laid. Round about the upright
slabs have been stood up, with the legends upon them
forbidding any further building within these charmed
enclosures.</p>

<p>No people like better to insult other people than
the Chinese, in spite of all the lovely adjectives Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Ralph showers upon them in the pages of <i>Harper</i>,&mdash;"polite,
patient, extremely shrewd, well dressed,
graceful, polished, generous, amiable"; while Dr.
Morrison, the "Australian in China," talks of "their
uniform kindness and hospitality and most charming
courtesy," and says again, "Their friendliness is charming,
their courtesy and kindliness are a constant delight
to the traveller." In illustration of all this there were
these men in prison at Kiukiang and Wenchow. Do
people at home realise what was the crime of which
they had been accused? Short of the Home Government,
it often seems as if the different European
communities in China could make themselves more
respected, and protect those who dealt fairly by them,
with their own right hands. No Government could
urge them to do so. But, as even Sir John Walsham
used to say, "There are so <i>many</i> things Englishmen
might do even in Peking&mdash;if they only would not
come and ask me if they might."</p>

<p>In 1897 a Chinese in foreign employ was had up
about an alleged debt of 500 taels. By a bribe his
accuser had the matter brought before a magistrate who
was well known as anti-foreign, and who no sooner
heard he was in foreign employ than he ordered him
to be beaten without going into the case. This was
contrary even to Chinese law. The unfortunate bookkeeper
was unable to do his work again for months;
he was disfigured past all recognition, and, indeed,
too horrible to look upon. His offence was "foreign
employ." Can we wonder that the Chinese are not

very fond of us? The marvel to me is that they
dare associate with us at all.</p>

<p>Other nations seem to protect their nationals and
those dependent upon them far more vigorously than
the British Government does. When Chungking was
first made a Treaty Port, the then British Consul, a
most able and energetic man, was not even advised
from Peking that the port was open. Consequently,
he was absent from all public functions instituted at
the formal opening, took no part in the drawing
up of the regulations under which British trade was
to be established there, had no voice in the rules
issued by the Chinese Customs. Subsequent incumbents
of the Consulate have not unnaturally employed
any liberty of action given them less in promoting
British interests than in keeping things quiet for the
Chinese, and so have refrained from endorsing the
requests made from time to time to have the obstructive
Customs rules modified or the position of the port
in any way improved. The rules, issued in Chinese,
were so impracticable that successive Commissioners
of Customs suspended their action from the day they
were published; but this suspension, it afterwards
appeared, was a privilege revocable at the arbitrary
will of the Commissioner for the time being, and an
American Commissioner revoked them to the detriment
of the only <i>bona-fide</i> European shipping firm as yet
established there, thus doing what lay in his power
to take away business from European firms and
throw it into the hands of the Chinese firms, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
continued as before to enjoy a suspension of the
Customs rules.</p>

<p>Business at Chungking is all carried on by so-called
chartered junks. They are not really chartered; but
before they can clear the Customs, they must fly a foreign
house-flag and number. The permission to fly this must
be obtained by a foreigner through his Consul. The
British Consul, up till then the only one there, resided
at the opposite end of the city to the business quarter,
where the Customs Office is situated. This entailed
some hours delay. And when it is considered that one
junk carries as a rule from fifty to a hundred packages
only, it "passeth the wit of man" to conceive why
this red-tapeism was allowed to continue. The China
Merchants' Steamship Co., the largest shippers in
Chungking, were allowed to obtain their "passes"
from the Custom-house direct&mdash;a great convenience,
as the Custom-house is in one part of this city,
the Customs' Bank in another, and the examining-pontoon
across the river at the head of a rapid.
The junks mostly lie in a reach below; and it is
no exaggeration to say that it takes a day for a
man to get round to the three places. Yet the
Customs rules do not allow the duty to be paid until
the cargo has passed examination at the pontoon;
nor is the cargo-boat allowed to leave it until a
duty-paid certificate is brought back and exhibited
at the pontoon. This necessitates the cargo being
left in an open boat all night at the head of a rapid,
and much loss has resulted from the delay that occurs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
there in any case. Consequently, this rule had never
been enforced, and the cargo-boat had been allowed
to leave and proceed to load the chartered junk in
safety immediately after examination. But an application
to his Consul by the Britisher was met by a
"despatch" in the stereotyped language, "I cannot
interfere with the Customs regulations."</p>

<p>The telegraph office, formerly situated in the business
quarter of the city, was then moved into the distant
country enclosure which forms a part of all Chinese
cities, because the manager owned a piece of land
there, and thus rented it to advantage. Naturally here
the foreign merchant could not expect a remonstrance
to be of any avail, as the telegraph is a purely native
concern.</p>

<p>It would take too much space to enumerate the
further difficulties to which a foreigner is at present
exposed. To enforce a claim for debt he must apply
to his Consul. A Chinaman unwilling to pay is never
at a loss to invent an excuse,&mdash;the papers are not in
order, just as in cases of sale the land was not really
his. If the Consul is content to become merely the
translator of these Chinese excuses, which by transmission
he appears, indeed, even to accept, and to a
certain extent to endorse, we, as the farmer said, "seem
to get no forrader." How far the actions of Consuls
in these matters, and with regard to obstructions about
buying land and renting houses, come from individual
action or from instructions from Peking, of course it
is not for a mere woman to decide. We used in China
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
at one time to put down everything that went wrong
to Lord Kimberley. Now even sometimes we fancy
it is a Kimberley legacy. But very likely we are
quite wrong.</p>

<p>It will be obvious from the above how much depends
upon the disposition of the Consuls. Naturally they
vary greatly. The theory used to be that they were
too apt to look upon themselves as protectors of the
Chinese against the encroachments of their nationals.
Having suffered severely under the most flagrant
specimen of this class, I am happy to add that I think
it is dying out. Most of the Consuls in China now
seem only too able for the importance of their posts.
At the same time, one never knows when a crisis may
arise; and then the men, who as a rule have been
foremost in all the social life each of his own port,
are admirably seconded by willing communities, that
rejoice to follow the lead of those who are certainly
generally in all things the opposite to the delightful
caricature sketch well known to have been written by a
leading member of the China Consular body:</p>

<p>Trembles at glances from Viceregal eyes,</p>
<p>And cowers before contemptuous Taotais;</p>
<p>But should mere nationals his aid implore,</p>
<p>Is quite the haughty personage once more.</p>
<p>Lives on the bounty of the public's purse,</p>
<p>Yet greets that public with a smothered curse;</p>
<p>With scowls that speak of anything but pleasure,</p>
<p>Daunts ill-advised invaders of his leisure;</p>
<p>From outward signs of courtesy exempt,</p>
<p>Treats their just protests with a fine contempt;</p>
<p>Does little, strives to make that little less,</p>
<p>And leads a life of cultured uselessness.</p>
<p>Such is the happy Consul. Such is he</p>
<p>That each aspiring sub. should wish to be."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even, however, where the Consul is all he should
be&mdash;and probably no body of men ever was more
respected and trusted than the British Consular Body
in China&mdash;yet British subjects' interests must suffer, if
the British Minister will not support them. Nor can
the British Minister do much, if the permanent officials
at the Foreign Office wish him to do little.</p>

<p>When two men were murdered at Wusüeh, the
village ought, at least, to have been razed to the ground.
When the Kucheng massacre occurred, the Viceroy and
the Chinese officials, who <i>laughed</i> about it all as they
talked with the British officials sent to settle about
compensation with them, ought one and all to have
been degraded at the very least. No one likes bloodshed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
The Chinese only get on as they do without
an army or a police force by means of very exemplary
punishments; they understand slight punishment as
a confession of weakness, or an acknowledgment that
the offender was not so much to blame after all. Nor
does any one who lives in China believe in Chinese
peasantry ever daring to murder foreigners except at
the instigation of men in high place. People in England
often fancy missionaries are very much disliked in
China. As a rule, they seem greatly liked and respected
each in his own neighbourhood, although in the abstract
officials and old-fashioned literati may object to them.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said about all these matters,
an English subject cannot but be pained on finding
how little British Consuls are able to effect in redressing
serious grievances, such as inability to buy
or rent land in the surrounding country, whereby we
were for many years forcibly compelled to live in a
Chinese house in a filthy street inside the walls of
an overcrowded Chinese city. Let a Frenchman or
a Russian be the aggrieved party, and instantly his
Consul is on the war-path, and the Chinese have to
give way at once. Englishmen have gone on paying
<i>likin</i> illegally, until a Frenchman, backed by his Consul,
successfully protested. British steamers are illegally
arrested and detained by the Chinese Imperial Maritime
Customs, and no redress is obtainable; when a French
steamer is only boycotted by Chinese shippers, an
indemnity is immediately claimed, and at once paid.</p>

<p>It is little things like these, for ever being repeated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
that lead to Englishmen in the west of China often
saying they must take out naturalisation papers as
Frenchmen or Italians in order to get on. Possibly
the bitterness thereby engendered will do the British
Government no harm; but it paralyses commercial
enterprise. And Manchester will suffer from it, when
it is too late to alter anything, unless a more consistent
and dignified policy be pursued in the Far East. People
have not been proud of England out in China lately.
It may be stupid of us all; but as a rule it takes
a good deal to make Englishmen ashamed of their
country. And that point has been unfortunately reached
some time ago.

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<i>CURRENT COIN IN CHINA.</i></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Taels.&mdash;Dollars.&mdash;Exchange.&mdash;Silver Shoes.&mdash;Foreign Mints.</p>
</div>

<p>She was not long out from England, and a <i>comprador</i>
order was as yet an unnatural phenomenon to her.
She supposed it was something like a cheque upon a
bank, or a circular note, with which Continental travel
had made her intimately acquainted. "What is the
value of a dollar in English money?" she had asked
before starting on her tour from Shanghai. "Oh yes,
I understand it depends upon the exchange. I used
always to keep myself in gloves on what one gained
in Italy. Now it is horrid; one gains nothing. I don't
quite know why it is. But how much <i>about</i> is the
dollar worth, when exchange is&mdash;is&mdash;nothing particular?"
Then she had such long speeches made to
her, and heard so much conflicting information, she felt
deafened, but ultimately arrived at the conclusion that
there were about&mdash;yes! <i>about</i> six dollars in an English
pound, and there ought not to be so many. Now,
somewhat to her consternation, she discovered that her
<i>comprador</i> orders had taels printed upon them; so she
made out her order in taels, secretly wondering what
they were. She had never seen them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think I got the right exchange?" she
asked of her Boy; then, trying to suit herself to his
needs, and speak English "as it is spoke," "He pay
my right money?"</p>

<p>"My no savey what thing one taelee catchee
Hankow side," said the Boy, with flippancy but decision.
He came from farther inside the province.</p>

<p>She felt abashed, and supposed she must just take
her money, hoping it was right. Next time she would
be wiser. Arrived at Ichang, she scratched out taels,
and was about to write in dollars.</p>

<p>"Dollars! Dollars aren't known at Ichang," said
the Captain.</p>

<p>"What had I better do?" she asked of the oldest
resident. Again she was overwhelmed with words.
But she gathered she ought to ask for taels.</p>

<p>"Taels don't exist," said the Captain. "I never
saw a tael, did you? He'll bring you your money in
lumps of silver, if you don't take care."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old resident, "you had better not
get lumps of silver."</p>

<p>"They vary in value, according to the quality of
the silver," persisted the Captain. "You won't know
what to do with them. You can't break them up.
You will have to weigh them. And what can you
pay for in lumps of silver? Nobody will take them
for anything you want to buy."</p>

<p>They actually both talked to her as if <i>she</i> wished
for solid, uncoined lumps of silver. She felt confounded!
But, determined to preserve her calm, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
said, "I had better write, and say I want so many
strings of cash, then, had I? Ten thousand cash?
Twenty thousand cash? I can't carry them, you know;
and I don't know where I can keep them. But I
must have at least so much money in hand, if it is
only to pay for my washing."</p>

<p>"Pay for your washing!" they both burst out, as
if that were a most superfluous proceeding.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't write for cash, I think," began a third
adviser. "I would write down how many taels you
require, and say you'd take it in cash."</p>

<p>"Then I shall never know if I get the right amount."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;h!" they all said, waving their hands, as if no
one ever did know if he got the right amount in China.</p>

<p>"It varies. It varies from day to day," said the
oldest resident.</p>

<p>Needless to relate, she never saw those cash, never
heard how many she had received, nor where they
were stowed away. The Boy said he had them, it
was all right. He said also that at Ichang it was
very shocking how few cash they gave for the tael.</p>

<p>She was determined she would learn Chinese, of
course! Was she not just out from home? And being
just out from home, and anxious to be polite to every
one, it was a trouble to her mind that she did not
know how to greet her teacher when he came. She
stood up, and rubbed her hands together, which, she
understood was the Chinese for a curtsey; but it seemed
feeble without a word, so she said, "Koom Shee! Koom
Shee!" as she had heard the country people say.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! you should not say <i>Koom Shee! Koom Shee!</i>
Not to a teacher, who comes every day," said a
Sinologue.</p>

<p>"He says it is quite right," said she. "I am sure
I understand that much. But he said I could also
say <i>Tsao</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;no! Not <i>Tsao</i>," said the Sinologue; but
he never made any suggestion as to what she should say.</p>

<p>"I could not think what I ought to say when he
went away," she continued. "But he says <i>Man man
tso</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Oh no!</i> that is a <i>great deal</i> too much to a teacher
who comes every day."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0138" id="i_0138"></a>
<img src="images/i_0138.jpg" width="549" height="395" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CHINESE MODE OF SALUTATION.</p>
</div>

<p>"Well, that is what he says," she repeated rather
wearily, after having waited a little to see if he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
suggest any polite speech for her. "I do want to say
something polite."</p>

<p>"It is very difficult to be polite in Chinese," said
the Sinologue solemnly. That seemed final. But she
asked another Sinologue. "No, I should not say <i>Man
man tso</i>. Not <i>Man man tso</i>," said he dreamily. "Not
to a teacher&mdash;who comes every day."</p>

<p>"But what do you say?" asked she in desperation.</p>

<p>"Well, it is very polite to say <i>Shao pei</i>&mdash;I don't go
to the door with you, you know; I only go a few steps
with you. That is the polite thing to say after a call
from a mandarin."</p>

<p>"But surely it would be polite to go to the door?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;in China it would."</p>

<p>"Well, I think anywhere it would be <i>polite</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, but not&mdash;not from a lady. It would not be
expected."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;h! yes! then I can say <i>Shao pei</i>." However,
she did not feel quite satisfied, and she watched her
opportunity.</p>

<p>Next time she heard a Sinologue converse with a
Chinaman, she listened to hear what he would say in
parting. Alas! it was not <i>Man man tso</i>, it was not
<i>Shao pei</i>.</p>

<p>"What was that you said to him in taking leave?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I didn't say anything,"&mdash;with the instinctive
horror of being detected in possibly a false tone.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, you said something as you turned away
and took leave. And I do so want to know what it
was, that I may know what to say."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I said&mdash;&mdash;" mumbling very much, so that it
was impossible to hear what he said. "I don't think
it was the thing to say to a man of his station and
quality. I think I should have said&mdash;&mdash; Let me see&mdash;
I really don't know what was the right thing for me
to say."</p>

<p>And so now she is giving it up&mdash;giving up being
polite in Chinese, giving up ever ascertaining the
value of money or the price of anything. For how
can things have fixed prices where money has none?
There is only one comfort to her soul: if any one looks
offended, or if a too sensitive conscience makes her
fear she has given cause of offence, she promptly says
<i>Tetsui</i>&mdash;"I am to blame, I apologise." No one has yet
made distinctly evident that he does not understand
her, nor has any Sinologue yet told her she is wrong.
<i>Tetsui</i> is therefore the one golden word for her. And
while she is in China she foresees she must live in one
constant state of being to blame.</p>

<p>In this manner I at the time recorded my first
impression of the coinage and language of China. But
the matter of payment is even more complicated than
I then fancied. The only coinage of China is copper
cash, of which about forty go to a penny. They are
round, with a hole in the middle, and generally about a
thousand are strung on two strings and tied together;
and when carried, hanging over the shoulder, they look
like so many snakes. But I say about a thousand
advisedly; for there are generally a number of small
and comparatively worthless cash in every string, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
average amount of these varying in different parts.
The lumps of silver with which my friends threatened
me are made up into what are called "shoes," but
what look like very large coarse thimbles. These are
of various degrees of purity, and their purity has to
be tested before they are weighed or broken up. In
Chungking there were three different degrees of purity
in different parts of the city; therefore it made quite
a considerable difference whether you agreed to pay
a sum of money in the upper, lower, or middle town.
And the result of so much difficulty about payment
is that every one is in debt to every one else, keeping
a sort of running account going.</p>

<p>Of late years foreign mints have been started in
several places; and lest this chapter should seem
altogether too frivolous, I here subjoin the essay that
gained the prize, when, at the Polytechnic Institution
in 1890, the Governor of Ningpo started an essay
competition, giving as his theme:</p>

<p>"The south-eastern provinces now have much
foreign money in circulation, and the natives consider
it a great convenience to trade. Should China set
about coining gold and silver money? Would it circulate
freely? Would it be advantageous to the country, or
the reverse?"</p>

<p>The Governor himself looked over the essays, and
awarded the palm to the composition of Mr. Yang,
a B.A. of Kwangtung Province, of which the following
is a translation:</p>

<p>"Those who treat at the present time of the causes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
which are draining away the wealth of China to
foreign countries are, as a rule, in the habit of confining
their observations to two of these causes: the
importation of foreign opium, and the purchase of
foreign ships and munitions of war. They appear to
be ignorant, indeed, for the most part, that there is
another cause at work, persistent, insidious, whose
effects are more far-reaching than either.</p>

<p>"The first silver money brought to China from
abroad was the so-called 'Luzon Dollar,' coined by
the Spaniards from the product of the mines which they
had acquired in America, a new country first settled
by them. The Spanish dollar was followed by others,
made in the same style&mdash;first the American, and then
the Japanese. From Kwangtung and Fukien these
invaders spread to Kiangsu and Chekiang, Kiangsi,
Anhui, and Hupeh, in the order named, with great
rapidity. Their beauty and convenience were soon in
everybody's mouth, and the loss to the country became
heavier and heavier as their importation increased.</p>

<p>"To speak of loss from the influx of foreign dollars
may appear paradoxical to those who have only eyes
for the palpable loss to the country caused by the
importation of foreign opium and manufactures and
the purchase of foreign ships and cannon. Very little
reflection, indeed, suffices to show the disastrous tendency
of exchanging for a useless weed the bounteous produce
of our harvests, of deluding with new-fangled inventions
the practical minds of our people, of spending on a
gun or a ship tens of thousands of taels. But I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
endeavour to show that the proposition is no paradox,
and that the loss to China caused by the influx of
foreign dollars is, if less visible on the surface, at
bottom none the less real.</p>

<p>"During the reigns of Tao Kwang and Hien Fêng
(1821-1862), to buy each of these dollars China parted
with eighty-five tael cents; and as the real value was
seventy-two tael cents, on every dollar which she purchased
she lost thirteen tael cents. As, taking all
the provinces together, she must have been purchasing
at least forty or fifty million dollars every year, she
must have been losing every year by exchange the
enormous sum of four or five million taels.</p>

<p>"Times have changed; but vast numbers of dollars
are yearly imported from various countries, most of
them composed of one-tenth alloy; and, in payment
of this silver blended with baser metal, our pure silver
is shipped away in heaps. Moreover, dollars which
are worth at most seventy-two or seventy-three tael
cents are sold in market at one, two, three, or four
tael cents more than that. Such a drain will end in
exhausting our silver supply, even if we had mountains
of it, if not checked betimes.</p>

<p>"We cannot prevent the importation of foreign
dollars, nor prohibit their use by the people; for the
people wish for them, although they are depleting the
country of its wealth. There appears to me only one
way of checking this depletion, and that is by China
coining dollars herself.</p>

<p>"Opponents will say, even if China coin them, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
will not circulate. They will point to two previous
instances where such an attempt was made and failed.
The first was towards the end of the reign of Tao
Kwang (about 1850): two officials obtained permission
from the Governor of Chekiang to start a silver-mint,
and everybody looked at the coins, rung them, and
declined to have anything to do with them. The
second experiment was made at Wusih by Mr. Lu
Sueh-tsun: he turned out dollars which compared
favourably with foreign dollars in every particular
except one&mdash;namely, that nobody would use them.
The opponents of the measure point to these two
examples, and say the coinage of dollars in China will
never succeed.</p>

<p>"Some of these opponents do not go so far, but
merely say that, even if the Chinese Government is
able to put home-made dollars into circulation, it can
only be in the southern and eastern provinces, as in
the north and west the people, accustomed to sycee
and paper money, would shrink from the manifold
inconveniences involved in a sudden change to a
dollar medium of exchange.</p>

<p>"This appears to me more the language of narrow-minded
pedants than of practical men of the world.
Which one of all who stand under China's sky and feed
off China's fields but desires his country's exaltation
and the depression of foreigners? If to-day all love
foreign money, it is because there is as yet no Chinese
money. Once let there be Chinese money, and we
shall see how many will leave it for foreign. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
two instances alleged above only show that the coins
which people looked at, rung, and rejected were false
in look and false in ring. The semi-private way in
which they were coined in a village was in itself
enough to excite the suspicions of the great mass of
the public. An Imperial Mint, openly conducted and
turning out good work, would arouse no such suspicions;
and its money would very soon be current, not only
in the provinces of the south and east, but also in those
of the north and west, for the following reasons:</p>

<p>"The travelling merchant and trader of the north
and west has now to carry with him both silver sycee
and copper cash. Copper cash is heavy, and it is
impossible to carry much value in that form; whilst
the carrying about of silver entails many and grievous
losses in exchange. It is natural to suppose that he
would welcome as the greatest boon a gold and silver
currency which, by its portability and uniformity of
value, would relieve him of the obstacles which the
present system in vogue in the north and west spreads
in the path of commerce.</p>

<p>"The opponents of an Imperial Chinese Mint for
the precious metals commonly adduce four dangers, the
contemplation of which, they say, should make China
hesitate to incur them. Let us look them in the
face. They are, firstly, the facility of counterfeiting
the new coinage; secondly, the difficulty of coinage, if
commenced; thirdly, the loss to China's prestige by an
imitation of foreign manufactures; fourthly, the possible
venality of officials and workmen in the Mint.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>"Would it not be the depth of pusillanimity, the
extreme of unreasonableness, for our great nation to
give up, for fear of dangers such as these, a plan which,
carried out under the guidance and control of well-selected
men, will admittedly dam the outflow of our
wealth, and put an end to our impoverishment, which
is now going on year after year for the benefit of
foreigners?</p>

<p>"The impossibility of coining the precious metals
without alloy will no longer afford the foreigner a profit.
This profit will go to our own Government, who will
not be taking it from the people for nothing, but amply
earning it by giving them a universal uniform medium
of exchange. Its universality and uniformity will relieve
the honourable merchant of the present uncertainty of
exchange, and deprive the shifty speculator of his
present inducement to gambling in time-bargains dependent
on the rise and fall (<i>mai k`ung</i>).</p>

<p>"I began this essay by enumerating various evils
which are sapping the wealth and power of China.
How best to counteract these evils is a problem which
our statesmen and politicians are now devoting their
zealous endeavours to solve. The measures hitherto
proposed involve, when compared with that which I
have advocated, a larger expenditure at the outset, and
do not seem to promise in any instance so speedy
a return of benefit to the nation. A gold and silver
coinage by the Imperial Government would, in all
probability, in a very few years be conferring on every
province of the empire advantages in comparison with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
which the initial inconveniences would hardly be worthy
of attention. It is, of course, an essential condition of
the success of the Mint that it should be organised in
such a complete manner as to leave no contingency
unprovided for, and thus to ensure its stability and
permanence. I shall be happy if any of my humble
remarks are worthy to contribute to such a result."</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Yang's essay seems already to have borne fruit,
and nothing could more check the little peculations so
rife in China as a proper coinage of the same value all
through the country. Yet such is the innate disorder
and corruption attendant upon all Government undertakings
in China, that, without the supervision of the
despised "foreigner," all such schemes must fail in gaining
the confidence of the people, as they have notably
failed hitherto. While we were in Chungking, the
Viceroy there introduced dollars coined by the Viceroy
of Hupeh; but as the local officials refused to take
these dollars in payment of taxes except at a discount
of 3 per cent., nominally for "shroffage," the people
naturally refused them, and they are now no longer to
be seen. The Chinese prefer the Mexican dollar,
firstly, because they are familiar with it; secondly,
because they can depend upon it. The statement in
Mr. Yang's jejune essay that the Chinese give pure
silver in exchange for foreign dollars containing 10 per
cent. alloy is, of course, absurd. Copper cash form the
real currency of the masses in China, and it is the
fluctuations between this, the only current coinage, of
late years shamefully debased, and silver (amounting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
in 1897 to 30 per cent.) that seriously disturbs the
equanimity of "the honourable merchant." Unfortunately,
so far each Viceroy seems to be setting
up his own mint, irrespective of others. The idea
of a Central Government, managing the customs, posts,
coinage, or even the army and navy, is altogether alien
to the Chinese mind.

<p>It is a popular error in England to suppose that
binding the feet is a mark of rank in China. In
the west of China women sit by the roadside begging
with their feet bound. In the far north, where women
do field-labour, they do it, poor things! kneeling on the
heavy clay soil, because they cannot stand upon their
poor mutilated feet. Another popular error in England
is that the custom was introduced in order to prevent
women from gadding about. Never in all the many
conversations I have had with Chinese upon this
subject have I heard this reason alleged or even
hinted at, nor is it ever alluded to in any of the Chinese
literature upon the subject. The popular idea in China
is that P`an-fei, a favourite of the Emperor Ho-ti, of
the Chi Dynasty, whose capital was Nanking, was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
beautiful that golden lilies sprang out of the ground
wherever she stepped; hence the name of "golden
lilies" for the hideous goatlike feet Chinamen so
strangely admire. Ho-ti is said to have so loved
P`an-fei as to have had golden lotus flowers strewn
on her path for her to walk on. But there is another
tradition that T`an-ki, the wife of the last Emperor
of the Shang Dynasty, who in despair burned himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
in his palace with all his treasures in 1120 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>&mdash;that
T`an-ki was the introducer of these strange feet. She
seems to have been a semi-mythical character&mdash;a
changeling, with "hinds' feet" covered with hair. So
she wound bandages round them, and wore lovely little
fairy shoes, and every one else tried to follow suit. But
to come to later and somewhat more historic times, a
King of the Sung Dynasty, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 970, had a favourite
wife Niao-niang, whom he used to like to see posing or
dancing upon golden lotus flowers. And to make her
feet look more lovely she used to tie strips of coloured
satin round them, till they resembled a crescent moon
or a bent bow; and thus the fashion began, some say.</p>

</div>
<p>It is obvious, however, that a nation that has not
stockings naturally takes to bandaging its feet, and that
so doing, quite without intending it, it is very easy to
alter the shape of the feet by binding them ever a
little tighter, as many a European lady has done with
her waist. Chinese civilisation being very ancient and
conservative, abuses there go on increasing, and become
exceptionally exaggerated. The Chinese are also as a
nation curiously callous to suffering either in themselves or
others, not taking pleasure in the infliction of it, as is the
case with some more highly strung natures, but strangely
indifferent to it. In all probability at first women
simply bandaged their feet somewhat tightly. And just
as a man in Europe used a little while ago to attach
especial importance to a woman's being well shod and
to the turn of her ankle, so did a Chinese man, till in
the course of a thousand years we have arrived at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
present abortions with a two-and-a-half-inch measurement,
as also at all these stories of long dead and gone
empresses and lotus flowers.</p>

<p>The method of binding and the period of beginning
naturally differ somewhat over the whole extent of this
vast empire. In the west binding seems generally to
begin at six years old. In the east it is generally from
five to seven, or at the latest at eight, years of age.
Tsai, the good-natured Governor of Shanghai, when I
met him there at a dinner party at our Chief Justice's,
looked across the table at me, and said in his somewhat
humorous, jerky voice, "I know what you want
to talk to me about. You want to talk to me about
footbinding. It is very hard, is it not? The poor
little things have but two years to run." So that it
would seem as if in his part of the country or in his own
family binding began earlier. In the east of China the
bandage is said to be of strong white cotton-cloth, two
yards long and about three inches wide; and I have
generally seen a two yards long bandage. The cloth is
drawn as tightly as the child can bear, leaving the great
toe free, but binding all the other toes under the sole of
the foot, so as to reduce the width as much as possible,
and eventually to make the toes of the left foot peep
out at the right side and the toes of the right foot at
the left side of the foot, in both cases coming from
underneath the sole. Each succeeding day the bandage
is tightened both morning and night; and if the bones
are refractory, and spring back into their places on the
removal of the bandage, sometimes a blow is given with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the heavy wooden mallet used in beating clothes; and
possibly it is, on the whole, kinder thus to hasten
operations. Directly after binding, the little girl is
made to walk up and down on her poor aching feet, for
fear mortification should at once set in. But all this is
only during the first year. It is the next two years
that are the terrible time for the little girls of China;
for then the foot is no longer being narrowed, but
shortened, by so winding the bandages as to draw the
fleshy part of the foot and the heel close together, till
it is possible to hide a half-crown piece between them.
It is, indeed, not till this can be done that a foot is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
considered bound. During these three years the girlhood
of China presents a most melancholy spectacle.
Instead of a hop, skip, and a jump, with rosy cheeks
like the little girls of England, the poor little things
are leaning heavily on a stick somewhat taller than
themselves, or carried on a man's back, or sitting sadly
crying. They have great black lines under their eyes,
and a special curious paleness that I have never seen
except in connection with footbinding. Their mothers
mostly sleep with a big stick by the bedside, with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
to get up and beat the little girl should she disturb
the household by her wails; but not uncommonly she
is put to sleep in an outhouse. The only relief she
gets is either from opium, or from hanging her feet
over the edge of her wooden bedstead, so as to stop
the circulation.</p>

<p>The Chinese saying is, "For each pair of bound
feet there has been a whole <i>kang</i>, or big bath, full of
tears"; and they say that one girl out of ten dies of
footbinding or its after-effects. When I quoted this
to the Italian Mother Superior at Hankow, who has
for years been head of the great Girls' School and
Foundling Establishment there, she said, with tears
in her eyes, "Oh no, no! that may be true of the
coast towns." I thought she was going to say it would
be a gross exaggeration in Central China; but to my
horror she went on, "But more here&mdash;more&mdash;more."
Few people could be in a better position to judge than
herself; for until this year the little girls under her
charge have regularly had their feet bound. As I have
understood, there the bandages were only tightened
once a week. The children were, of course, exempted
from all lessons on those days; and the Italian Sister
who had to be present suffered so much from witnessing
the little girls' sufferings that she had to be continually
changed, no Italian woman being able to endure the
pain of it week after week. Of course, the only reason
they bound the children's feet was from anxiety about
finding husbands for them in after-life, and from fear
of parents not confiding their children to them unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
they so far conformed to Chinese custom. But this
year the good Mother has at last decided that public
opinion has been sufficiently developed to make it
possible for her to dispense with these hateful bandages.
"Do you suppose I like them?" she said, the last
time I saw her. "Always this question of new shoes
of different sizes, according as the feet are made smaller;
always more cotton-cloth being torn into bandages:
the trouble it all entails is endless&mdash;simply endless."
This was a point of view I had never considered. But
it is a comfort to think the good Mother is delivered
from it; for she wrote to me in the spring of 1898
that she knew I should be glad to hear fifty little girls
had just been unbound, and no more girls were to
have their feet bound under her care.</p>

<p>Dr. Reifsnyder, the lady at the head of the Margaret
Williamson Hospital at Shanghai, says toes often drop
off under binding, and not uncommonly half the foot
does likewise. She tells of a poor girl's grief on
undoing her bandage&mdash;"Why, there is half my foot
gone!" and how she herself had said to her that,
with half her foot, and that half in good condition,
she would be much better off than those around her.
And so it has turned out. This girl walks better than
most others. Her feet had been bound by a cruel
mother-in-law; and, according to Dr. Reifsnyder, of all
cruel people a Chinese mother-in-law is the cruelest
to the daughter-in-law under her keeping. The foot
of another daughter-in-law, she knew, dropped off
entirely under the process of binding. Another error,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Dr. Reifnysder points out, is that people often think
that, after the first, binding does not hurt. She had
in her employ a woman fifty years old; and she knew
that, after standing more than usual, this woman's
feet would still bleed, as is not unnatural, when it is
considered this woman, weighing one hundred and forty
pounds, stood up in shoes two and a half inches
long.</p>

<p>Dr. Macklin of Nanking, on my asking him what
sort of cases he had come across, he having the
reputation of thinking many things more pressing than
unbinding the feet of the women of China, at once
told me of a little child of a poor family brought to
his hospital with an ulcer that had begun at the heel,
caused by the bandages. When he first saw the child,
the ulcer extended half-way up to the knee; and the
child would have died of blood-poisoning in a few
days, if she had not been brought to him. Another
of his cases ended more sadly. The poor little girl
was the granddaughter of an official, her father a
teacher. When only between six and seven, she was
brought to the hospital, both her feet already black
masses of corruption. Her relations would not allow
her feet to be amputated; so in a few months they
dropped off. The stumps were a long time in healing,
as the skin was drawn back from the bone. The child
was taken home, gradually became weaker and weaker,
and after a year and a half of suffering died.</p>

<p>Dr. McCartney of Chungking mentions one case
in which he was called in to a little girl. When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
removed the binding, he found both feet hanging by
the tendons only, with gangrene extending above the
ankles. Immediate amputation was at once necessary;
but the unfortunate child will have to go through life
without feet. The mother of the child was a confirmed
opium-smoker, and her indifference had led to the result
indicated. The two greatest curses in China are, in
his opinion, opium-smoking and footbinding. Another
case was an unmarried woman who had paralysis in
both legs. She was treated by removing the bandages
on her feet, by massage, and electric current. In less
than a month she was able to walk. Her trouble
was caused by nothing more or less than footbinding.
He says the Chinese know nothing of the physiology
and anatomy of the human body; and this ignorance
causes untold suffering to the women and children of
China. Footbinding has nothing to recommend it
but the dictates of a senseless fashion. Women with
small feet are unable to stand still, but are continually
swaying and taking short steps, like a person on tiptoe.
He defies any Chinaman to tell him there is not great
pain and discomfort in footbinding. Chinese women
were disinclined to confess pain. To do so would be
<i>pu hao i-su</i>&mdash;indelicate. There is in a bound foot a
space like that between the closed fingers and the ball
of the thumb. This space does not touch the shoe,
and is consequently soft and tender. Perspiration
gathers there, and, unless kept extremely clean, eczema
results, and finally ulceration and mortification. He had
had several cases of double amputation. From the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
the feet were bound until death, they caused pain and
were liable to disease. Not only did these serious local
troubles exist, but others occurred in the internal organs,
and in many cases affected the offspring.</p>

<p>It would require a medical work to describe the
various maladies more or less directly traceable to
binding. Let it suffice here to point out that when a
Chinese woman walks it is on her heel entirely, and
to suggest that the consequent jar to the spine and
the whole body is very likely the cause of the internal
maladies of women, so general, if not universal, in those
regions where binding is generally practised. Lady
doctors have already observed that in certain parts of
China where binding is universal, whatever disease a
woman may come to the hospital for, she is always
afflicted with some severe internal trouble; whereas
in those parts where only a few bind, it is rare to find
these same maladies.

<p>To turn to a cheerfuller subject. Although the
Roman Catholics, the American Episcopal Church,
and some other missionary bodies have in former days
thought it wiser to conform to Chinese custom in the
matter of binding, there have been other missionary
bodies, that have for twenty years or more refused to
countenance it. One or two examples of their methods
of work will probably suffice. The Church Mission
at Hangchow opened a school for girls in 1867, and
in 1896 Mr. J. L. Stuart wrote:</p>

<p>"The Mission undertook from the first to feed and
clothe and care for the girls for about ten years; and
it was required that the feet of the girls should be
unbound, and that they should not be compelled to
marry against their own consent. The school opened
with three scholars; but the number soon increased
to a dozen, and then to twenty, and after a few years
to thirty, and then to forty, and for five years it has
had fifty pupils. After the first few years, no solicitations
were ever made for pupils, and they were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
taken under eight or ten years of age; but there have
always been more applicants than can be accommodated.
For ten years the pupils have furnished their
own clothing and bedding, and a few have paid for
their food. The superintendent of the school took the
ground in the beginning that, as the Mission undertook
to support and train the girls, it was not only a right
but it was an obligation to require the girls to conform
to rules that were considered right and proper as
far as possible. The success of the school proves the
wisdom of the stand taken at the time. The girls have
a good yard in which to play, and no sprig of grass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
can make headway where their big feet go romping
about, and their rosy cheeks and happy faces are in
marked contrast to the average Chinese girl seen in
the street and in their homes. As the girls grow up
and are ready to leave the school, in almost every case
they have been claimed by some Christian young man
who is not ashamed of their big feet. In the course of
the past twenty-eight years many pupils have been sent
out from this school; but, so far as is known, none of
them have ever attempted to rebind their daughters' feet."</p>

<p>A letter from Kalgan in the far north shows very
quaintly the difficulties encountered by an American
lady missionary, evidently an ardent anti-footbinder:</p>

<p class="left65 p2">
"<span class="smcap">Kalgan, China</span>, <i>September 24th</i>.</p>

<p>"Anti-footbinding seems to be very much entangled
with match-making on my part. I perhaps wrote about
a little girl who came from four days' distance here to
school, and unbound her feet, because I was to help
the young man selected to be her husband, if he took
a wife with large feet. The engagement papers were
not made out, because the family wanted more betrothal
money than I cared to give. I did not limit the young
man at all. He could give what additional sum he
pleased; but I would not give more than twenty-four
tiao, about two pounds ten shillings; and thought that
a good deal for a little girl of fourteen. The young
man did not have any money, and rather wanted a small-footed
wife; but his elder brothers exhorted him, and
he gave in: but no additional money is to be expected
from him. The little girl herself admires her young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
man very much, and said if her father did not give her
to Yü Ch`ien (the young man) she would jump into the
well when she got home. I have just heard that the
father is dead. He was an opium-smoker, and wanted
to betroth the girl where they could get the most
money; but the brothers said, 'Let our sister be
happy, even if the money is less.' His death may
bring on the engagement, as they wish the money
for the funeral expenses, I suppose. Did you ever hear
of Chinese who had enough money on hand for funeral
expenses?</p>

<p>"One of our schoolboys, whose mother engaged
him to a little girl eight years old, told his mother
he wanted his bride's feet unbound, so she could enter
our girls' school here.</p>

<p>"I took the schoolgirls out for a pleasure-trip
yesterday. They went to the beautiful new Russian
church and churchyard, prettily laid out with trees,
flower-beds, and a chime of bells in the bell-tower.
Afterwards we went to a temple in the city. One
of the priests said, 'Why don't your girls bind their
feet?' I said, 'Why don't you bind your feet?' 'I!
I'm a <i>man</i>!' I didn't talk further, as there was an
unpleasant crowd gathering to watch the girls.</p>

<p>"Mr. McKee, of Ta-tung Fu, Shansi, is exercised
over the future of his schoolgirls. His wife has now
the charge of a school of six girls. No girls with
bound feet can enter. Mr. McKee says no boy in
Ta-tung will engage himself to a large-footed girl,
even if his parents are willing; and if they are willing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
he or his big brother is not. I said, 'In Fenchou Fu,
Shansi, there is a boys' school, and they can't get
Christian girls enough for their brides.' But he said,
'No, Ta-tung has such a bad reputation for selling
daughters, that no good family will let its daughters
be married outside of the city or very near villages,
for fear it will be said they have been sold.' The
girls are young yet, and there is no immediate necessity
for their marriage; so Mr. McKee trusts that Providence
will provide bridegrooms when the time comes."</p>

<p>In April, 1895, I was happy enough to start the
T`ien Tsu Hui, or Natural Feet Society. Up till
then foreigners who were not missionaries had done
but little, if anything, to prevent footbinding. It was,
therefore, quite a joyful surprise to find that pretty well
all the Shanghai ladies whom I asked were willing
and eager to serve upon the committee. We began
very timidly by republishing a poem written by a
Chinese lady of Hangchow, sent down by Bishop
Moule, and happily for us translated into English
verse by Dr. Edkins, for one of our initial difficulties
was that not one of us could read Chinese. We then
ventured on another poem by another Chinese lady.
After that we published a tract written in English by
Pastor Kranz, sat upon and somewhat remodelled by
the whole committee, then translated into Chinese for
us by the Rev. Timothy Richard's Chinese writer. It
is difficult for English people to understand what
anguish of mind had been suffered by all the ladies
on the committee, before we could decide into what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
sort of Chinese we would have our tract translated.
There were so many alternatives before us. Should
it be into the Shanghai dialect? and then, Should there
be other translations into the dialects of the other
parts? The women would then understand it. But,
then, the women could not read. And were we
appealing to the men or the women? And would
not our tract be thought very low and vulgar in such
common language? Should it be translated into
ordinary mandarin? But would not the learned even
then despise it? We knew of course&mdash;we all sat sadly
weighted by the thought&mdash;that feet are the most <i>risqué</i>
subject of conversation in China, and no subject more
improper can be found there. And some of us felt
as if we should blush before those impassive blue-gowned,
long-tailed Boys, who stand behind our chairs
and minister to our wants at tiffin and at dinner, when
the latter knew that we&mdash;we, their mistresses&mdash;were
responsible for a book upon footbinding, a book that
any common man off the streets could read. In the
end we took refuge in the dignified Wenli of the
Chinese classics, confident that thus anti-footbinding
would be brought with as great decorum as possible
before the Chinese public, and that at least the literati
must marvel at the beautiful style and learning of the
foreign ladies, who, alas! could not read one character
of the little booklet, whose type and red label we all
examined so wistfully. We circulated our books as
well as we could; we encouraged each other not to
mind the burst of ridicule with which we were greeted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
by the twenty-years-in-China-and-not-know-a-word-of-the-language
men. Our one French member was most
comforting with her two quotations, "La moquerie
provient souvent d'indigence d'esprit," and "La moquerie
est l'esprit de ceux qui n'en ont point." But, to use the
Chinese phrase, our hearts were very small indeed; for
we knew the custom was so old, and the country so big.
And what were we to fight against centuries and millions?</p>

<p>There was a drawing-room meeting held at Chungking,
in the far west of Szechuan; and it was a most
brilliant affair. The wealth of embroideries on the
occasion was a thing to remember. One young lady
could look neither to the right nor to the left, so bejewelled
was she; indeed, altogether she was a masterpiece
of art. But all the Chinese ladies laughed so
gaily, and were so brilliant in their attire, that the
few missionary ladies among them looked like sober
moths caught in a flight of broidered butterflies. Every
one came, and many brought friends; and all brought
children, in their best clothes too, like the most beautiful
dolls. At first, in the middle of the cakes and tea,
the speeches seemed to bewilder the guests, who could
not make out what they were meant to do, when their
hostess actually stood up and addressed them through
an interpreter. Then there was such eager desire to
corroborate the statements: "On the north bank of
the river near Nanking&mdash;&mdash;" "Yes, yes!" exclaimed
a lady from Nanking; "they don't bind there! And
they are strong&mdash;very." Then, when the speaker went
on to say that on the road to Chengtu there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
city where a large part of the population all intermarried,
and did not bind their women's feet, being
of Cantonese descent, Cantonese ladies nodded and
smiled, and moved dainty little hands with impetuous
movements, as if eager for interpreters in their turn
to make themselves understood by the great, jolly
Szechuan dames round them. And when the speaker
further spoke of parts of Hunan where rich and poor
alike did not bind, the two solitary representatives of
Hupeh, the boastful, could bear it no more, but with
quiet dignity rose, and said, in their soft Hupeh voices,
"In Hupeh, too, there are parts where no woman binds&mdash;none."
Next a missionary lady in fluent Chinese
explained the circulation of the blood, and with an
indiarubber pipe showed the effect of binding some part
of it. There were no interruptions then. This seemed
to the Chinese ladies practical, and it was quite striking
to see how attentively they listened. This speech was
afterwards a good deal commented on. A Chinese
lady then related how she had been led to unbind,
ceasing any longer to feel delight in the little feet
that had once been such a pride to her. After which
another English lady explained in the local dialect
our one tract in the classic language, the rather difficult
Wenli. The meeting was then thrown open, and at
once the very smartest of the Chinese ladies present
came forward to make a speech in her turn. All
present were agreed that footbinding was of no use,
but it could only be given up by degrees. <i>Man
man-ti</i> (Little by little) was the watchword. Then, just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
as at an English meeting, a number of ladies went on
to a dinner party. But the others stayed and talked.
"Did you see my little girls listening?" said one
mother. "They are thinking they will never have
their feet bound again." And certainly the expression
of the little girls had been eager in the extreme&mdash;poor
little crippled creatures! with their faces all rouged to
simulate the roses of healthy exercise.</p>

<p>But what did the men say? What they thought of
the meeting we did not know; for as the husband of
one of the ladies said next day rather crossly, "Oh,
of course the women liked it! They don't want to
bind their feet!" It seemed a step, however, to have
got a Chinaman even to admit that.</p>

<p>At an anti-footbinding meeting another day, when
those opposed to binding were asked to stand up, all
the men present but six rose to their feet, and a
merchant among the audience began a speech against
binding. Some days afterwards a mandarin, calling,
took up Pastor Kranz's pamphlet lying on the table,
and said: "Ah, I have the larger copy of this book
with pictures. No, I was not at the meeting the
other day, but my people were. As to unbinding,
the elder women can't; you see, their toes have
dropped off. But my little girl of six is not having
her feet bound any more. She screamed out so directly
she laid her head upon her pillow, I could not bear
to hear it. Besides, she got no sleep." He was a
man of means, and made no reference as to any
possible difficulty about marrying her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>It was a little later on that we got our first great
push forward. One of the examiners at Peking lost his
father, and being in mourning could not, in accordance
with Chinese usage, continue to hold office, so returned
to his home in the far west, and there found his little
daughter of seven crying over her footbinding. Whilst
on the way he had come across one of our tracts.
First he had his child's feet unbound; then he thought,
Could not he write something better on the subject&mdash;an
appeal to his nation that would carry power? After
many days of thought, he wrote what we commonly
call the Suifu Appeal; for having signed it with his
name and seal, and got five of his friends, leading
men of the neighbourhood, to add their testimony and
names, they proceeded to placard it over the walls of
Suifu, against the examinations that were just coming
off there, that all the young men might carry back
the news of it to the different homes from which they
came. No sooner did we get a copy of this pamphlet&mdash;which,
curiously enough, was brought to me by Mr.
Upcraft, then on his way down-river to be married
to the very lady who had first told me of the missionaries'
efforts against footbinding, and thus impelled
me to try to do what a simple lay woman could&mdash;than
we at once began to reprint and distribute this appeal
to all the ten thousand students who were coming up
for examination to Chungking. We were more lavish
of our funds than they of Suifu, and tried to give
each a copy to take home. Then came a letter from
the Shanghai manager of the great China Merchants'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Company, the one great commercial body of China,
also semi-official, saying he heard that there was a
wonderful tract in the west, and he would like a copy,
that he might reprint it at his own expense, and send
it to be circulated through his native province of
Kwangtung.</p>

<p>About a year afterwards we heard that the Pu Tsan
Tsu Hui (No Bind Feet Society) had been formed at
Canton by Kang, the Modern Sage, the adviser of the
youthful Emperor, who has lately had to fly for his
life, and only done so in safety under an English man-of-war's
protection; that ten thousand fathers of families
had thereby pledged themselves not to bind their little
girls' feet, nor to marry their sons to bound-foot girls;
that they had opened offices in Shanghai, and were
memorialising Viceroys and high officials on the subject.
We had ourselves memorialised the Emperor in characters
of gold on white satin enclosed in a beautiful
silver casket; but although the American Minister, the
<i>doyen</i> of the Diplomatic Corps, had done his best for
us, we had never been officially informed of our
beautiful memorial, signed by our President on behalf
of nearly every European lady residing in the East,
even getting into the young Emperor's hands, the
Tsung-li Yamen preferring to keep it on their own
shelves. This had discouraged us from going on to
memorialise Viceroys, as we had originally intended.
But now, to our delight, we heard of the Viceroys
responding to the Chinese society. Chang-chih-tung,
the one incorruptible Viceroy of Hupeh and Hunan, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
that beautiful literary Chinese, in which he is unrivalled
condemned footbinding, and we immediately proceeded
to placard the cities of his two provinces with his
condemnation; whilst the Governor of Hunan, since
degraded by the Empress-Dowager, dared to go a step
farther, and forbade binding. The Viceroy of Nanking
struck his breast; then lifted up his hands to heaven,
and said it was a good work, and he too would give a
writing. But he died shortly afterwards. The Viceroy
of Chihli admonished all his subordinate officials to
discourage binding, each in their separate districts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another most unexpected adherent had
come forward. Duke Kung Hui-chung, one of the
lineal descendants of Confucius, wrote: "I have always
had my unquiet thoughts about footbinding, and felt
pity for the many sufferers. Yet I could not venture
to say so publicly. Now there are happily certain
benevolent gentlemen and virtuous daughters of ability,
wise daughters from foreign lands, who have initiated
a truly noble enterprise. They have addressed our
women in animated exhortations, and founded a society
for the prohibition of footbinding. They aim at
extinguishing a pernicious custom." And he applied
for copies of all our tracts that he might compile a
book out of the best ones and circulate it.</p>

WEST OF CHINA.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We were naturally immensely pleased by his phrase
"wise daughters from foreign lands," and began to
forget that any one had ever laughed at us, as Chinese
ladies now came forward to start a school for girls of
the upper classes, the first rule of which is that all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
who enter it must mutually exhort one another to
unbind their feet. Shanghai ladies held drawing-room
meetings, where they heard from Chinese ladies themselves
how they were never free from pain, admired
their elegant raiment, and shuddered over the size of
their feet; whilst a meeting was held at one of the
principal silk factories, when about a thousand Chinese
women were addressed by European and Chinese ladies
on the subject.</p>

<p>As showing the Chinese view of the matter, it may
interest some to read a rough sketch of the famous Suifu
Appeal, that has had such an awakening influence over
China. It is not at all what English people would
write; but there is no doubt that it does appeal to the
hearts of Chinese.</p>

<p>Recalling the anti-footbinding edict of the Emperor
Shun Chih (1644-1662), the immediate predecessor
of Kang Hsi&mdash;an edict too much ignored&mdash;and pronouncing
footbinding actually illegal, Mr. Chou begins
without any preliminary flourish with the statement
that "No crime is more criminal than disobedience
to the Emperor, no pain more injurious than the
breaking of the bones and sinews. Even the most
stupid man knows this." He dilates upon the wickedness
of disobeying the Emperor Shun Chih's edict,
and disregarding the precepts of Confucius, who taught
that men should respect and not injure their own
bodies. "But now," he says, "they have their young
daughters' feet bound tightly till they bleed, and the
bones and sinews are broken.... Manchus and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Mongols and Chinese bannermen do not bind their
women's feet, upper and lower classes alike.... The
provinces of Chihli, Kwangtung, and Kwangsi, after the
Taiping rebellion was suppressed, acknowledged footbinding
was wrong, and the half of them abandoned
the practice. In Szechuan Province, in the cities of
Pengchou and Peng-chi-hien, Hung-ya, and Sa-chang,
there are some wise men who have changed this fashion
of small feet into natural feet. Let other places do
the same."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Chou refers to the countries beyond the
seas&mdash;England, France, Germany, America, etc. The
women there are free from the pains of footbinding.
Only the Chinese voluntarily incur suffering and injury;
parents neglect teaching their daughters the five
womanly virtues; and teach them instead a bad custom,
spoiling their feet. He next points out that "distinctions
of rank are not indicated by the feet. Moreover,
the laws of the empire ordain the punishment
of the wicked by cutting in pieces, beheading, and
strangling; but there is nothing about binding of the
feet: the laws are too merciful for that. When in a
fight or quarrel people's limbs are injured, there is an
appointed punishment. But people have their young
daughters' feet broken on purpose, not heeding their
cries and pain. And yet parents are said to love
their daughters. For what crime are these tender
children punished? Their parents cannot say. It
makes the daughters cry day and night, aching with
pain. It is a hundred times as bad a punishment as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
robbers get. If a man is beaten in the <i>yamen</i>, he can
get over it in a fortnight. But if a girl's feet are bound,
she suffers from it all her life long, and her feet can
never regain their natural shape."</p>

<p>Mr. Chou has no patience with fathers who torture
their little daughters because their ancestors did it. "I
do not think much," he says, "of such respect for
ancestors." Then he goes to the practical side of
the question, and shows how, if robbers come or a
fire breaks out, the men of the family have to leave
the women behind (as they actually do) to commit
suicide, or suffer a still worse fate. Whereas, if
the women had natural feet, they could defend themselves,
or escape, as well as the men. Men should
not despise girls with natural feet. "In times of
calamity the noble and rich are the first to suffer,
because their women, brought up in ease and luxury,
cannot escape. If any accident suddenly occurs, they
can but sit and await death; whilst those with unbound
feet can carry heavy things or use weapons, and need
not fear being left behind or killed. They can even
be trained in military exercises, so as to defend themselves
against attack, and thus enjoy security. This
is the happy course."</p>

<p>It is a man's business, Mr. Chou says he hears
foolish people say, to defend women; but from ancient
times to the present day even high officials have not
always succeeded in defending their wives. And the
inability of the women to escape leads to the death
of the men who stay to defend them, and so the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
family perishes. "I hope people will be wise and
intelligent, and give up this stupidity."</p>

<p>"The present is no time of peace. Foreign women
have natural feet; they are daring, and can defend
themselves; whilst Chinese women have bound feet,
and are too weak even to bear the weight of their
own clothes. They think it looks nice; but in reality
it does not look nice, and weakens their bodies, often
causing their death. I am a student, a man of no use
in the world; but I must try to do people some good,
and I may be of some use by writing this. The people in
Szechuan Province are numerous and crowded together,
and there are many idlers and bad characters. Many
unforeseen things may arise. Am I right or wrong?"</p>

<p>Many people ask whether it is possible for women
to unbind. It is not only possible, but many women
have done so, and can not only walk now, but declare
they are free from suffering. It is, however, obvious
that their feet cannot regain their natural shape; and
probably it is even in some cases impossible to dispense
with the bandages. In all cases unbinding is a painful
process, requiring much care. Cotton-wool has to be
pushed under the toes; massage is generally resorted
to; and not uncommonly the woman has to lie in bed
for some days. But I have seen many women who
have unbound at forty, and one even at sixty. All
those I have seen have done so under direct Christian
influence; but I have heard of large groups of Chinese
women unbinding quite apart from all foreign influence.
And so, with Chinese literati writing anti-footbinding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
tracts; a Chinese Viceroy circulating one with a preface
of his own; a descendant of Confucius collating and
distributing our publications; the leading Chinese
periodical advocating our cause; an influential Chinese
Anti-footbinding Society established in Shanghai; and,
best of all, Chinese ladies of distinction coming forward
to found a school for girls of the upper classes,&mdash;it
seems almost as if we had already set the women of
China on their feet again. But with this reaction set
in at Peking, it may be that the hardest and fiercest
part of the fight is yet to come, and that Chinese women
may yet need more help from us before the custom
of a thousand years is for all time done away, and
"golden lily" shoes only to be found in the shape of
Liberty pincushions.</p>

<p>A man once quaintly said to me, "Whenever I
want to know what men really are, I consider
what they have made of their women." We may also
learn something by considering what men say they
admire in women. And for this purpose a few extracts
from the <i>Peking Gazette</i>, the oldest newspaper in the
world, and to this day the official organ of China, will
go farther than a hundred pages of hearsays. Let us
consider three cases from one year only.</p>

<p>"<i>May 2nd, 1891.</i>&mdash;The Viceroy at Canton submits
an application which he has received from the elders
and gentry of the district of Shun-teh, asking permission
to erect a memorial arch to an old lady who
has seen seven generations of her family, and is at
present living under the same roof with four generations
of her descendants. The lady, whose maiden
name was Lin, is the mother of the distinguished
General Fang Yao, and is in her eighty-second year.
She has six sons, forty grandsons, one hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
twenty-one great-grandsons, and two great-great-grandsons.
Her life has been one of singular purity and
simplicity, fully entitling her to the honour bestowed
by law upon aged people of distinction.&mdash;<i>Referred to
the consideration of the Board of Rites.</i>"</p>

<p class="caption">MEMORIAL ARCH LEADING TO CONFUCIUS' GRAVE.</p>
</div>

<p>"<i>February 6th, 1891.</i>&mdash;Li Hung-chang submits a
case of filial piety which was brought to his notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
by Wu Fu-lun. An assistant deputy magistrate on the
Chihli expectant list had a daughter renowned for her
docile disposition and her filial piety. In the summer
of the present year her father was deputed to look
after some work in connection with the river embankments.
While he was away, his wife became dangerously
ill, and was most tenderly nursed by her daughter,
who went the length of cutting off a piece of her flesh
to make soup for the invalid, and who offered to give
up her own life should that of her mother's be spared.
When her elder brother proposed to go and inform
the father of the dangerous state of his wife's health,
she prevented his doing so by pointing out that her
father had enough to do looking after his own work,
and to add to his anxiety by conveying to him such
news would serve but little purpose. Two days after
P`eng-chu's return his wife died, and the daughter
refused to take any food for several days. Seeing by
so doing she was causing great grief to her father,
she forced herself to take a little gruel. Some time
after he was ordered away on river-work, and during
his absence she again refused to take any nourishment.
While away he was taken ill, and asked for leave
to return home. On his arrival he was met by his
daughter, who informed him that she dared not die
without first telling him, but that now he had come
back she wished to state that it was her intention
to go and wait on her mother in the shades below.
In spite of all entreaties she then resolutely abstained
from all food, and died some days after. Memorialist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
agrees in thinking that it would be a thousand pities to
pass over such a remarkable instance of filial devotion
without remark, and would ask that the Board be
directed to make out a scroll to her memory.&mdash;<i>Request
granted. Let the Board of Rites take note.</i>"</p>

<p>It will be noted, in both these cases, it is rather
what may be called the domestic virtues that have
won attention. General Fang Yao's mother is honoured
for her numerous offspring, as also for the singular
purity and simplicity of her life; Wei P`eng-chu's
daughter for her devotion to her mother. But the
next case is of quite a different character, and shows
once more how China is always the land of the unexpected.
In advanced America, have women ever
yet received decorations for heroism in war? Whilst
here, in old-fashioned China, in the <i>Peking Gazette</i>,
we read:</p>

<p>"<i>January 23rd, 1891.</i>&mdash;In 1858 Liuchou, a city in
Kwangsi, fell into the hands of rebels. A great number
of its inhabitants died in its defence, or, preferring
death to dishonour, committed suicide rather than
submit to their conquerors. Nor did the men alone
show forth their bravery in this respect; their example
was largely followed by the women. When the city
was recaptured, orders were issued that a list should
be prepared of all those who had suffered, in order that
some steps might be taken to commemorate their self-sacrifice.
At the time when these orders were issued,
every one's attention was concentrated on suppressing
the rebellion, and it was not easy to give effect thereto.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
When peace was restored, instructions, however, were
again given that inquiries should be made from time
to time as originally directed. Ma Pi-yao, the Governor
of Kwangsi, accordingly submits a list drawn up by
the Mah`ing District Magistrate of the names of thirty-four
women who died in those troublesome times, and
thus preserved their honour. Memorialist thinks that
the memory of these women is worthy of all honour,
and would suggest that the Board be instructed to
prepare a posthumous testimonial of merit commemorative
of their action. Thus will their pure souls be set
at rest, and others be encouraged to follow in their
footsteps.&mdash;<i>Request granted. Let the Board of Rites
take note.</i>"</p>

<p>It will be observed that several years had been
allowed to elapse before these thirty-four women
received official honour. Yet is it not the case that
in most other countries they would have remained
unnoticed to all time? The wording is also noteworthy:
"a posthumous testimonial of merit commemorative
of their action" is to be prepared. "Thus
will their pure souls be set at rest, and others be
encouraged to follow in their footsteps."</p>

<p>It is the custom of most men to write of the mock
modesty of the women of China. They may have
very good reasons for doing so of which I know
nothing. With regard to women, as with regard to
everything else in China, I can but write of them as
I have found them. To establish the truth of any fact
or any series of facts needs an amount of research and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
study I have not been able to give; nor does this book
aim at being a storehouse of learning and a book of
reference for all time, but rather at giving a picture,
for those who know nothing of them, of a people among
whom I have at least lived on somewhat intimate
terms for the last eleven years. At the same time, in
writing about Chinese women I am burdened by the
reflection that possibly I am in some ways better
able to express an opinion about the men, and men
about the women. To tell what I can, however: doubtless
Chinese ladies' speak of many subjects with the
freedom of the days of Queen Elizabeth; but how
women can be called mock modest who always remain
fully clad in such damp heat as leads men to strip to
the waist in all their shops, as also at their dinner
parties, when summer is at its height, I cannot understand.
The amount of suffering from heat that must
be undergone by women in consequence of their
observance of decorum seems not at all to have been
sufficiently appreciated. I have never yet seen a Chinese
woman insufficiently clad, nor committing any act that
could possibly be considered indecent. The whole
behaviour of Chinese ladies would lead me to suppose
that they would shrink from anything of the kind.
It is not in accordance with their etiquette that they
should talk to men&mdash;not their own relations; yet
whenever I have seen them brought into intercourse
with foreign men, or even Chinese men, on matters
of business, I have been struck by both their ease of
manner and their quiet dignity. It is true they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
rather given to rising to address a man, as if he were
a superior being; but, further than that, they in nowise
convey the impression that they are accustomed to
consider themselves as at the service or pleasure of
men. It must be understood I am here simply writing
of the ladies, with whom I have held friendly intercourse,
not of poor peasant-women, nor of those whose
society European men in treaty ports most frequent.
Although for these last I must add that, however
immodest their conduct may be, their manners and
behaviour have none of that repulsive disregard of
decency, that makes it to a woman so painful to hold
intercourse with those acting in a similar manner in
London, New York, or, worse still, Paris. It is not
unnatural that this should be so. The women
leading a vicious life in China have for the most
part been sold into slavery in their childhood,
their families not having enough rice to feed them;
and it is from no bad inclinations of their own that
they are found in the houses where foreign or Chinese
men find them. Doubtless there are in China, as in
other countries, women who prefer vice to virtue; but
if I am any judge of expressions or manners, these
last must be rarer in China than in any other country
with which I am acquainted.</p>

<p>At a ladies' dinner party, the conversation turning
upon a new Governor, who had just arrived with
several concubines, I found all the ladies at table
expressing a horror at the idea of being, or letting
any one of their relations become, the number two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of any man; whilst my hostess explained to me that
concubines were, as a rule, women of lower birth, or
sprung from families fallen into indigence. But what
struck me most was that there was no tittering, nor
appearance of innuendo, whilst discussing the subject,
which simply came forward, because none of the ladies
saw how they could interchange visits with the ladies
of the new Governor; and they also thought an official
of such habits of life was not likely to administer
the district well. The coarseness and directness of
Chinese women often shock European ladies very
much. But whilst glad that we have ourselves so far
improved in this respect, I have never felt sure that
the fine ladies of Queen Elizabeth's time were not
more modest really than the fine ladies of Queen
Victoria's.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that all we European ladies
who go up-country in China have to alter our
wardrobes very considerably, <i>if</i> we mean to be on
friendly terms with Chinese ladies; whilst the wife
of a French Consul had to replace in its case an
old master she had brought out to China, such an
outrage upon decency was it considered. The German
wife of a Commissioner of Customs, regardless of its
effects upon her husband's official visitors, amused
herself by decorating her hall with life-size pictures
of nude female figures. She was rewarded by her
man-servant always pointing them out to visitors, when
she was out, as the pictures of herself and her various
friends. Without entering upon the vexed question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
as to the decency of the undraped, it can be imagined
that no pictures of the kind exist in a country where
no woman ever bares any part of her person in society.
And far from this indicating mock modesty, it appears
to me the natural outcome of a classic literature,
every passage of which might be put into the hands
of the traditional young girl. When it is further
considered that, unlike the images of the two adjacent
countries of India and Tibet, the images of China
are quite untainted by any suggestion of impropriety,
I think I have some grounds for saying that, at all
events, virtue is sufficiently in the ascendant in China
for vice to pay it the compliment of hypocrisy, if no
more. And has any nation yet got farther than this?</p>

<p>It is, of course, well known that as a Chinaman gets
richer he buys more concubines. These do not take
rank as his wife, and the whole proceeding is considered
rather as a concession to weakness than as a practice
to be admired. He is, however, careful to get them
from as respectable families as he can. A Chinaman
also takes a concubine into his house for life; he has no
idea of enjoying the few fleeting years of her youth and
prettiness, and then setting her adrift with a little sum
of money. She becomes from the moment she enters
his household as much a charge to him as his wife is,
and her children are just as much his lawful children as
his wife's are. At the same time, concessions to weakness
are said to open the floodgates to yet greater evils;
and it may be so in China.</p>

<p>At a dinner party I was asking after the pretty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
bright little daughter of my host, who in company with
another pretty doll of a girl and an infant prodigy of
a younger brother had paid me a visit the year before,
when a lady beside me, putting up a warning hand across
her lips, just after the fashion of a regular fine lady of
Europe, spoke in easy accents from behind it: "Best
ask no questions. They are by another woman. His
wife has but this one daughter that you see." The
speech and the manner of it seemed to give me a new
insight into Chinese life. The year before the other
woman had been living in his house, his wife had herself
brought the infant prodigy often to see me. The little
girls had come more than once. Now a time of
financial crisis had passed over the city, he had
established his number two with her children in a
little shop near by, and the subject was not to be
mentioned in the hearing of his wife and daughter.
Further inquiry revealed that he had done a thing
outrageous, not to be spoken of except in a whisper.
Under stress of poverty he had sent another concubine
into a convent to be a nun. This was atrocious, for by
all Chinese rules she was a member of his family, for
whom he was bound to provide for the rest of her days.</p>

<p>What is the position of women when they are
married? It is so hard to describe this in any country.
And the difficulty is increased in China, because we are
so prone to connect the idea of marriage with love and
love-making. There is nominally none in China, where
as a rule the young man does not see his bride until
she is his wife. She then becomes the household
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
drudge, wears poor clothing in comparison with the
daughters of the house, and is the servant of her
mother-in-law. Often and often have I wished that
it was not so, and that in going to a house I could
talk with the
wistful young
daughters-in-law,
who glance at me
from under their
eyelids, and look
as if they would be so receptive of new ideas, being,
like most ill-used people, quite ready for a revolt of
some sort. But it is the elder lady who does the
honours, entertains the guests, and regulates the
household. And who more set in her ideas than a
grandmother of many grandchildren?</p>

<p>There is one Chinese family that has for many
years shown us kindliness. We have assisted at its
weddings and its funerals, and its young men have
spent long hours of the days, when they had nothing
else to do, at our house. One day the ladies announced
they were coming. And they came; but, alas! as
is usual, in such numbers, and with so many women
attendants, it was difficult to find chairs enough for all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
much more conversation. How merry they were, as
they looked about at all our foreign things, all new to
them! But their especial delight was our battledore
and shuttlecocks. They had been accustomed to use
the heels of their crippled feet for battledores, and
were not easily tired of playing in our pleasanter
fashion. It was one of these girls who afterwards at
a dinner party consented to show me her foot. For
a year after that she was busy with preparations for
her trousseau, all apparently made at home under her
own supervision; and, to my great regret, I have seen
nothing of her since her marriage. We were away
for a time, and since then she has had a child. A
Chinese lady never goes about whilst expecting, nor
whilst her child is very young&mdash;at least, those I know
do not. Curiously enough, for a month after child-birth
Chinese coolies object to even carrying a woman
in a sedan-chair. There are in China many curious
traces of the same idea, that led to the service for
the churching of women. There is some objection to
women sleeping upstairs in a house frequented by men;
and when a woman in our house was put to sleep in
a room that happened to be over the entrance, some
Chinese considered it very damaging to my husband's
business. In China a husband and wife very rarely
go out or travel together. On one occasion, as I relate
elsewhere, an old-fashioned inn actually refused to
receive us on that ground, and we were nearly benighted
before arriving at another village, where our
servant had the assurance to pass me off as a man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>It must not, however, be assumed from all this that
Chinese women take no part in affairs. A Governor's
wife is always supposed to be the keeper of his official
seal, and is therefore never expected to go out and
pay visits. When my husband was obliged to go to
Shanghai on business, it was his Chinese employés who
immediately suggested that I should keep the keys of
the safe, and supervise the accounts in his absence,
this being what they said the wife of a Chinese man of
business would undertake. Nor is it unusual, my
husband says, for a business man to say to him, "I
must go home and consult my wife before concluding this
bargain." When we first arrived in Chungking, the
wife of a formerly very wealthy merchant came at once
to see me, begging that some place might be found in
my husband's business for her husband, who had unfortunately
become impoverished. I promised to mention
the matter; but as she proceeded to enter into details,
and my knowledge of Chinese was even less then than
it is now, I called for our cook to interpret, and to
my amusement presently heard him say, "I don't know
why you trouble my mistress about all this. Foreign
ladies are not like our ladies; they don't understand
anything about business, and take no part in their
husbands' affairs." This he said in a tone as if explaining
that we were ignorant, frivolous creatures;
and it must be remembered that, like most Chinese
who go into foreign employ, he had been uniformly in
service with foreigners since his earliest years.</p>

<p>When a young man in my husband's business was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
taking to dissipated courses, it was his mother who
came off in her sedan-chair into the country to interview
my husband. And very definitely she knew what
she wanted,&mdash;that her son should be given employment
at a distance, and thus separated from the many undesirable
acquaintances he had formed. She begged
my husband also to give him a talking to, and told
him exactly what she thought he had better say; then,
having laid her point of view very clearly before him,
begged that her visit might be kept a secret from her
son, and so departed. I must add that, for all her
being a lady, she went on her knees to my husband
on arrival, and tried to do so again on going. But
in conversation with him she was anything but on
her knees.</p>

<p>Except among the poorest of the poor, who do
field-work or carry water, the women of China do
little beyond suckling children and making shoes,
except in the treaty ports, where now large numbers
of them are employed in the factories lately started.
They smoke and gossip, give and go to dinner parties,
and one of their great delights is to go on pilgrimages
to distant shrines. It is sometimes stipulated before
marriage that a woman shall go on so many pilgrimages
during the year. Even when nuns invite ladies to
come and enjoy themselves with them, it means drinking
wine, smoking, and playing cards; and not uncommonly,
in the west of China at all events, smoking
includes opium-smoking. The ladies who are regular
opium-smokers sit up late at night, and do not get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
up till five or six in the evening. They mostly have
bad health, and generally say they have taken to opium-smoking
because of it. Whatever effect opium may
have upon men, the various ladies I have seen at ladies'
dinners generally return from the opium-couch with
their eyes very bright, their cheeks very red, and
talking a great deal of nonsense very excitedly. But
afterwards they look yellow and unhealthy, mostly with
sunken cheeks. They seem no more ashamed of it
than ladies are of taking wine in England. But those
who do not smoke seem to think it a rather disgraceful
proceeding. A lady will draw herself up, and
say, "None of the members of my family smoke opium&mdash;not
one." But at a good many dinner parties the
opium-couch is prepared with all its elegant accessories.
And at the only Chinese country house, at which I have
stayed, the ladies' one idea was to ask me into their
bedrooms to smoke opium. Naturally, my acquaintance
is rather with Szechuan ladies. Cantonese seem altogether
different. And I gather that there must be a
much more cultured set in some parts of China, judging
from the ladies engaged in starting the High School
for Girls in Shanghai. Of those I know in the west,
only one young girl could read and write. She was
talked of with admiration by young men, who asked
if I knew her, and if she were not awfully clever.</p>

<p>Foreign men often get the idea that women rule
the roost in China, because when they want to buy a
house or bit of land the sale is often delayed owing to
some old woman of the family not agreeing to it. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the scolding tongue of an old woman has before now
proved too much for a British Consul to withstand.
But it must be remembered what a dull, mulish
obstinacy is that of the Chinese man, and that somehow
or other the Chinese woman has to get on with
him. At Ichang, in one street at least, the men were
said to be constantly beating their wives; and I recollect
once seeing a woman, who, after a storm of invective
against her husband, threw herself down on the road
there and kicked and screamed. She was very red,
as if she had been drinking too much wine; and I still
remember the sheepish air of the man, as he stood
and watched her kicking. He certainly did not attempt
to lay a hand upon her whilst we were by. But during
all the years I have been in China this is the only case
of the kind I have seen. In a Chinese city one does
not at night hear the cries of women as one too often
does in London. And on the whole it would appear
as if husbands and wives got on very well together, if
without very much affection. A woman who kills her
husband is still condemned to death by the lingering
process, namely, to being sliced to death; but though
this shows the horror entertained of so dastardly a deed,
yet in reality, even for such a crime as this, she is put
to death first and cut in pieces afterwards.</p>

<p>Meng Kuang is one of the typical women of China.
Contrary to the usual custom, she seems to have chosen
her own husband, and went to his house dressed in
all the splendour of a Chinese bride. For seven days
he did not speak to her, nor answer one of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
questions. At last he told her he did not like silks
of various colours, nor a painted face, nor blackened
eyebrows. At once she transformed herself into a
plainly dressed, hard-working wife; she became noted
for her virtues; and her name is on the lips of all the
people of China, somewhat after the fashion of the
patient Griselda of old.</p>

<p>A prettier story is told of the wife of the Emperor
Yuan-ti in the Han Dynasty (about the third century <span class="s08">A.D.</span>).
The Emperor was inspecting a collection of wild animals,
tigers and others, when a bear broke loose. Climbing
up the railing of the enclosed space, he was getting
to the top, and all the other women were running
away, when Chao I. advanced as if to meet the bear,
standing fearlessly in front of him with a determined
air. The guards happily killed the bear, before he
could attack her; but the Emperor turned to Chao I.,
and asked her how it was she was not afraid. Her
reply is beautiful: "Wild animals are generally content
with one victim. I advanced to place myself as a
shield for you." For this she was greatly honoured
in her lifetime, and has ever since been held up as
an example of womanly courage and devotion.</p>

<p>It only remains to add that whilst a roomful of
Chinese ladies presents a very pretty appearance, from
the exquisite gradations of colour of their embroidered
skirts and jackets, the brilliancy of their head ornaments,
and their rouge, yet, taken individually, probably no
other nation is so deficient in charm. Their idea is that
is it indecorous to show the figure; therefore only their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
deformed feet, cased, it is true, in beautifully embroidered
little shoes, and their faces, are seen; even the hands,
which are small and very elegantly shaped, with taper
fingers and filbert nails, are concealed in their large
sleeves. Their faces at parties are often so rouged as
to look like masks, their lips coloured, their eyebrows
darkened, and their hair so anointed as to give a shining,
semi-metallic setting to the face. Their skirts are very
prettily made, in a succession of tiny pleats longitudinally
down the skirt, and only loosely fastened together over
the hips, so as to feather round the feet when they move
in the balancing way that Chinese poets liken to the
waving of the willow. Their outer jackets in winter,
often of plum-colour satin, with gold-embroidered
sleeves, are rather like old-fashioned spencers and
unobjectionable; but the under-jackets&mdash;at a party a lady
often wears three&mdash;are of an ugly cut, especially in the
back, where they are made so as to stick out instead of
hanging flat over the shoulders. And when the ladies
divest themselves of their skirts&mdash;you always ask a
Chinese lady to lay aside her skirt, as in England you
ask her to lay aside her cloak&mdash;any dress more ugly
could hardly be imagined than the long, sloppy-looking
under-jacket over rather full, straight-cut trousers,
possibly of red satin, gorgeously embroidered with
life-size butterflies. There is no single feature in the
face that we could call pretty, and in accordance with
etiquette the face is entirely devoid of expression. I
have never been able to find anything pretty about
a Chinese woman except her hands and arms, both of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
which are very prettily modelled. Doubtless her feet
and legs would be too, if let alone. Now her poor
legs are like two sticks.</p>

<p>Although often what one must call very well bred,
there is nothing pretty or taking about Chinese ladies'
manners. But whether in spite or because of this want
of charm, the women of China give me the idea that,
if once set upon their feet again, they will become a
great power in the land&mdash;not witching men's hearts
away, but guiding them in childhood in the way in
which they should go, and in after-years pre-eminently
calculated to be companions, counsellors, and friends.
Confucius and Mencius are both said to have had
remarkable mothers; and it is at least noteworthy that,
since the Chinese have taken to mutilating the feet of
their women, there has not been one man whom they
reckon great born among them: so true it is that
any injury to the women of a nation always reacts
upon the men with redoubled force.

</p>
</div>

<p>In China a bride usually rides in a richly embroidered
red sedan-chair, decorated with flowers, and hired
for the occasion. Not long ago in Canton city a man
hired a chair to carry his bride to his homestead in
the suburbs. The distance was great, and the hour late.
When the four chair-coolies and the lantern-bearers
arrived at their destination, the chair containing the
bride was deposited outside the doorway to wait the
auspicious hour selected for opening the door to admit
the bride, and the coolies adjourned to an opium-den;
and as they had travelled a long way and were tired,
they soon fell asleep. How long they dozed they knew
not; but on awakening, they returned, and found the
bridal chair outside the doorway. They came to the
not unnatural conclusion that the bride had already
entered the household, and that the chair was left there
for them to take back to the city. Since they had
all received their pay in advance, they did not stop
to make further inquiries, but hurried home with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
chair, put it in a loft, and, rolling themselves up in their
beds, slept the sleep of the just. In the meantime
the bridegroom heard the bridal party arrive, but had
to wait the stroke of the auspicious hour before welcoming
the bride. At last the candles were lit, incense-sticks
were lighted, the new rice and viands for entertaining
the bride were served, the parents-in-law put
on their best suits, and so did the bridegroom, and
with much pomp and ceremony the door was thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
wide open; but as far as the lantern's light would reach,
lo! there was not a trace of the bridal chair, or bride,
nor a single soul to be seen. Great was their consternation,
and it became greater still as they concluded
that bandits must have kidnapped the bride, and would
hold her for ransom. The district officer was aroused,
the case was reported to the village justice of the
peace, and search parties were sent out in every
direction. The bridegroom, though distracted, had
sense enough to rush to the city and make inquiries
of the chair-bearers. The coolies were dumbfounded,
and explained what they had done. Together they
climbed to the loft, opened the door of the chair, and
found the demure-looking bride, long imprisoned and
half-starved, but still appearing to her best advantage
in her beautiful bridal gown. The bride appeared to
have known that she was being carried backwards and
forwards; but could not protest, because it is the custom
for brides not to open their lips till the marriage
ceremony is performed. Hence all the trouble.</p>

<p class="caption">WEDDING PROCESSION.<br />
<i>Lent by Scotch Presbyterian Mission.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This little story, taken almost verbatim from a
Chinese newspaper, shows how far a bride's silence
is carried. During all the days of reception after the
wedding she is supposed to stand up to receive each
incoming guest, who may make what remarks he pleases,
even of the most personal nature, but never a word
may she say; whilst attendant maids pull back her
skirts to show how small her feet are, etc.</p>

<p>At one wedding I saw the poor bride grow so painfully
crimson under the comments of a very young man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
that I took for granted he must be some rude younger
brother, and without thinking said so, and found I
had done quite the right thing; for the youth&mdash;who
was no relation at all&mdash;incontinently fled, feeling he
had over-stepped the bounds of propriety. Besides
not speaking, the bride is supposed not to eat. At
the only wedding-feast I have attended&mdash;I have been
to several receptions&mdash;the unfortunate bride and bridegroom
had to kneel and touch the ground with their
foreheads so often, that even if well nourished one
wondered how they could live through it. The bride
had to serve all the ladies with wine, the bridegroom
to go round the men's tables and do likewise. When
the size of the bride's feet is further considered, and
the weight of the jewellery in her hair, one wonders
a little in what frame of mind the poor bride ultimately
approaches her groom. It must certainly be in an
absolutely exhausted condition of body.</p>

<p>An amusing matrimonial incident may be worth
repeating here. A young fellow was to be married
on a certain lucky date; but his business having taken
him away just before the event, he found it impossible
to get back in time. He wrote to his parents, begging
them to get the ceremony postponed. To this suggestion
many objections were raised by relatives and
friends and invited guests, and a strong despatch
was forthwith prepared, peremptorily commanding his
attendance on the original date. Again the bridegroom
pleaded business, and said that he really could not
come, whereupon the incensed father straightway took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
his departure for regions unknown, leaving the mother
to do as she liked in the matter. The latter was a
woman of original ideas, and, finding herself thus left
alone, resolved, for the honour of the family, to resort
to strategy. Giving out that the bridegroom had
actually returned, but would not be visible until the
day of the marriage, she cleverly dressed in male
attire a buxom daughter, who is said to have been at
all times very like her brother, and made her act the
part of happy man throughout the ceremonial. When
the latter was finished and the deception was disclosed
or discovered, the hymeneal party is said to have
broken up in fits of laughter, and in praise of the
mother whose genius had evolved so satisfactory a
method of overcoming a serious domestic difficulty.
The proxy marriage will, it is said, hold good, and,
<i>nolens volens</i>, the son is now regarded by his family
and friends as a married man.</p>

<p>When one of our many cooks once wanted a wife,
he discussed the matter in very businesslike style with
my husband. "I can get a wife in Szechuan for ten
dollars," he said. "But, then, I can know nothing
about her family and habits, as I could if I took a wife
from Hupeh"&mdash;his own province. "It is true there
I should have to pay more. But here all the women
drink wine and smoke, and many of them smoke
opium. And you never can know the truth beforehand.
Now, if I find after marriage that the woman I have
chosen smokes opium, there will be my ten dollars
gone, and nothing to show for them. I shall wait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
till I can go home to my own province. Aren't you
going that way soon, master? Promise you will take
me when you do." However, after all these wise
sayings, he was over-persuaded by the account he
heard of some woman, married her, and was, I think,
very fortunate in her, but that the poor creature died
of some painful internal disease two years afterwards.</p>

<p>Our water-coolie made such a fuss over his wedding,
gave such a feast, invited so many guests, and borrowed
so much money to defray expenses, that I do not see
how it is possible in all the course of his life for him
to get out of debt again; for though he had made
an elaborate calculation that each wedding guest would
give a present worth more than his share of the feast
would cost, and that he himself would thus really make
money by it, he found himself disappointed. It is
curious as, perhaps, indicating the mortality among the
women of China that all our servants, with the exception
of one who has left our service, have lost their wives
at least once during the twelve years I have been in
China; and not one of the wives can have been
over forty.</p>

<p>The men seemed proud of their wives, and good to
them according to their ideas; but it certainly was extraordinary
how little they seemed to feel their loss when
they died. Yet I suppose they care sometimes. Whenever
we visit in Chinese houses, my husband generally
tries to rejoin me when he can, knowing that my knowledge
of Chinese cannot carry me very far, and that
consequently my intercourse with the ladies of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
house is apt to become rather fatiguing to both parties
after a time. On one occasion I was surprised to see
him come in so very soon, and with two young men.
One of the young fellows said to me in a good-humoured
way, "We want him to enjoy himself, and we notice
he is never so happy as when he is with you. Oh,
yes! we have husbands like that too." One of the
governors of Chungking was said, indeed, to be so fond
of his wife as to order naval reviews on the river for
her amusement. He built a specially pretty pavilion
in the highest part of the city for her to have dinner
parties there, and possibly it may have been partly grief
over her loss&mdash;she died of the fright caused by a very
great fire that all but burnt their official residence&mdash;that
made him afterwards go out of his mind for a
time. Another Chinese official, ordered to take up
high office in Tibet, was so determined his wife should
accompany him, that, as the Tibetans will not allow
Chinese women to pass a barrier a few miles beyond
Tachienlu for fear of the Chinese settling down and
overrunning the country, he had her dressed as a man
and carried in a sedan-chair, which she never got out
of. So it seems some Chinese husbands value their
wives beyond the price they pay for them. But with
our servants that last seemed to be all they thought
of. And yet I still hear the soft caressing tones in
which our head servant's wife used always to address
him. She was a very plain woman, but so quiet, and
made so little demands for herself, wanting always
apparently only to be serviceable, that as her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
rose in social position and wealth it always touched me
to see the way in which this honest, homely creature
would look round on the fine ladies she was brought in
contact with, and who at first tried to put her down, but
were always in the end won over by her perfectly
unassuming manners.</p>

<p>Another woman's husband was a man of violent
temper, who insisted upon her working very hard; and
the result was continual bickering between the couple,
which frequently led to the interchange of blows and
bad language. The wife appealed on several occasions
to her mother's people for protection; but after trying to
comfort her, they always sent her back to her husband.
About a month after the marriage the husband ordered
his wife one day to go and cut firewood on the hills;
but not having been accustomed to carry burdens, she
declined to go, and received in consequence a severe
beating. A little later she was again beaten and abused
by her husband for not washing his clothes clean
enough. About the same time she made use of a
sum of 400 cash (not quite a shilling) belonging to
her husband; and when he discovered the fact, he gave
her a sound thrashing with a stick, and vowed that he
would repeat the treatment on the following day if she
did not produce the money. A month passed, during
which continued squabbling occurred between the man
and his wife, the latter having frequently to go without
food, and being threatened with a divorce for her bad
behaviour. At last the woman, exasperated by the
treatment she was receiving and dreading the disgrace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
of a divorce, determined to make away with her
husband. A year before, while still unmarried, she had
accompanied an old woman in the village on a herb-gathering
expedition on the hills, and remembered her
companion pointing out to her a poisonous plant, which,
if eaten, cut asunder the intestines and caused sudden
death. Having gone on several occasions to gather
firewood, she kept careful watch for this particular plant,
and succeeded in collecting a handful, which she hid
away until she could find a favourable moment for
making use of it. At last she found her opportunity
one day when her father-in-law, her husband's brothers,
and her sister-in-law all happened to be from home, and
only she and her husband were left in charge of the
house. Shortly after noon she began to prepare
the evening meal, and poured over the vegetables the
infusion obtained by boiling the poisonous plant. She
handed his supper to her husband, left their portion for
the remainder of the family, and then went out on the
excuse of having to make some purchases. The father
and his three sons returned shortly afterwards; and
being hungry after their day's work, they all partook
heartily of the poisoned food. Symptoms of poisoning
very soon followed, and the whole family was found by a
neighbour lying on the floor in a state of great agony.
Two of them were saved by means of emetics; but the
father, the woman's husband, and a brother of the latter
all died the same night. The woman was found, and
handed over to the authorities, who, after a protracted
trial, in which she declared her innocence, found her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
guilty of the murder. She was condemned to death
by the lingering process on two different counts, and
would, as the law provides, receive some additional
slashes of the knife at the time of the execution. All
the poisonous herbs in the district were ordered to be
removed, so as to prevent the repetition of such a crime
in future. When a parricide occurred in ancient times,
the authorities used to order that the whole city, where
such a hideous crime had been committed, should be
razed to the ground; and on the Yangtse the traveller
sees the ancient site of the city of Chungchow on an
island without now a house upon it, because of such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
crime, the city having by order been moved to the
river-bank, where it now stands among its groves of
waving bamboos.</p>

<p>The following story tells again of wifely affection,
and incidentally throws a little light upon Chinese
clairvoyance, a subject which seems to attract more
attention in England than in China now.</p>

<p>A Nanking lady was sad, very sad. Her husband
had left her for business far away, and had sent home
only a few letters. Many times did she send word by
his friends requesting him to return, but he did not
come. At last, in despair, she called in a fortune-teller,
who was supposed to be endowed with supernatural
knowledge of everything past, present, and future.
After consulting his books, the fortune-teller's face
assumed a thoughtful and anxious expression. In trembling
accents he addressed the sad wife thus: "O lady,
your husband has changed his sphere of business many,
many times. Ill-luck has pursued him everywhere.
Money he has now none; but, what is worse, he is
lying dangerously ill in a lonely inn, hundreds of miles
from here." The wretched lady was heartbroken, and
began to weep copiously. The fortune-teller comforted
her, and rapidly turning over the leaves of his mystic
book, he joyously exclaimed, "Saved!" Then he
explained that a certain lucky star was obscured by
a dark cloud; and that if it could be made to shine
again, her husband would rise from his bed of sickness,
and make a great deal of money. About two
shillings was the sum charged for working the miracle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
of dispelling the dark cloud. While the fortune-teller
was on his knees, earnestly praying his god to deliver
the absent husband from the clutches of the evil one,
who was obscuring the lucky star, the door was abruptly
pushed open, and there, standing on the threshold with
a bag over his shoulder, full of shoes of silver and
gold bars, was the long-absent husband. The wife
gave a cry of joy and rushed forward. The confused
fortune-teller, terribly frightened, hurriedly sought an
exit by the back door, but slipped, fell, sprained his
ankle, and broke his head. The husband did not wish
to mar the joy of his return by any harsh measures,
and let off the now thoroughly wretched fortune-teller
with a reprimand.</p>

<p>Births, marriages, and deaths follow each other in
all our newspapers. I will not say more about births
than that the Chinese are all born with a round black
mark about the size of a penny at the base of the spine.
It disappears generally before they reach eight years old.</p>

<p>As to deaths, all the money that is left from
weddings may be said to be spent upon funerals,
which are the grand moment of a Chinaman's life.
Then Taoist priests are called in to officiate; for whilst
every one belongs to the three religions in China,
each religion especially takes certain parts of life for
its care. The best sites are reserved for graves; the
best wood is used for coffins; the merriest music to
our ears is that heard at funerals. But of all funerals of
which I have heard, I think this one is the most amusing.
A woman about fifty years old, fearing that her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
son, a worthless spendthrift, would not accord her a
grand funeral after her death, hit upon the plan of
enjoying one before that event. She fixed a day,
notified her friends and relations to come dressed in
mourning, hired many priests and monks and all the
paraphernalia usual at funerals, including a splendid
coffin and a green baize sedan-chair. Amidst much
weeping and praying she was carried all about the
city in the sedan-chair, followed by the coffin and
surrounded by mourners. Can any one living, ever
before or since, have been so perfectly happy? For,
as a rule, attaining the highest earthly bliss, we fear
its loss or diminution; but this woman had nothing to
fear. She had had her funeral.

</div>

<p>Missionaries generally say that the Chinese
are frightfully immoral. So do the Americans
and Australians, excluding them as far as they can
from their respective countries. But, brought up on
the English saying that "Hypocrisy is the compliment
vice pays to virtue," I always think virtue must be
in the ascendant in China for vice so to slink into
corners and hide its head before it. There certainly
is not the slightest outward appearance of vice in
Chinese cities. And I have always understood that
everywhere, except in the foreign settlements, where
it is certainly not the case, very decided repressive
measures are used. Shanghai, once the Model Settlement,
is looked upon as a hotbed of corruption by
Chinese fathers up-country, who say gravely they would
not dare to send their sons there, whatever business
advantages are offered, until their principles are quite
firmly established. Up-country it is European morals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
that Chinese find as shocking as Australians find
theirs. It is impossible for me to enter into details
here; but there are certain things, alas! too customary
among Europeans, which to every Chinaman are an
abomination. It is well to bear this in mind, perhaps;
and it is to be hoped that increased intercourse may
lead Europeans to think disgraceful what Chinese
already think so, and Chinese to be bound by the
European code where, if anywhere, it is higher than
their own, rather than, as so often occurs, to lead each
nation to accept the other's lower ideas.</p>

<p>As new suggestions however, are always more
interesting than trite generalisms, I must mention the
peculiar measure devised in 1891 by his Excellency the
Viceroy at Nanking to keep up the standard of morality
among his writers and the higher class of employés.
Shortly before, one of the composers of memorials had
taken to leading a fast life, frequenting places not over-respectable.
One day he leaned out of a wine-shop,
and saw two men, dressed in black, standing quietly
by his horse. He took no notice of the matter, but
kept on drinking. When he left the place and walked
up to his horse, the two strangers retired a pace or
two. Climbing into the saddle, he rode slowly along,
cooling himself in the evening breeze. He soon heard
footsteps, and perceived the men were following him.
His heated brain imagined fearful consequences. The
mysterious personages might be bandits or secret
society men bent on assassination or plunder. He
whipped up his horse, and made for his official quarters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
in the residence; but his pursuers were fleet of foot,
and kept up with his not very fast pony. On reaching
the Viceregal residence, the writer called upon the
guards to arrest the two bold men, who came up
breathless. But the guards did not move to obey
his orders, and the mysterious beings stepped up,
saluted, and said, "Sir, do not feel angry or apprehensive.
We are members of the Secret Police of his
Excellency the Viceroy. We have received instructions,
to follow any and all the officials and gentlemen connected
with the office, and report to our master where
they go, their actions, behaviour, and conduct." Then
they turned, mingled with the crowd, and disappeared.
Next day the writer's pony was reported to be for
sale, and since that memorable evening he has not
revisited his former haunts. Possibly this method
might be adopted with advantage by any high official
in England, who was as solicitous about the conduct
of his subordinates as this Chinese Viceroy.</p>

<p>Probably no one knows better than Li Hung-chang
how to get hold of other people's money. Here is
an idea of his for collecting contributions to a Famine
Relief Fund. He furnishes a long list of subscriptions,
mostly of £150 each, from officials whose generosity
was due to the promptings of their parents or other
relatives now deceased. Each donor had been granted
permission to erect an archway (<i>pai fang</i>) to the
memory of the person, who first inspired him with the
idea of contributing to the relief of suffering humanity.
Among those to whom this honour was accorded were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the President and members of the Chinese club at
Yokohama, whose joint contributions amounted to £300.</p>

<p>The west of China is exceptionally decorated with
these memorial arches, generally erected to the memory
of chaste widows and incorruptible officials, who, to
judge by the arches, seem more numerous than one
would otherwise have thought. I remember the interest
with which we approached one in course of
construction. It was a very hot day, and this <i>pai
fang</i> was being erected on a slight eminence, where
the people told us no rain had fallen for forty years,
although thunder-showers refreshed the country all
round it. We ate our luncheon under its shadow, and
observed that it was one of Li Hung-chang's arches,
erected to the memory of a dead man, the inspirer to
an act of charity towards the famine-stricken. The
Chinese are a people altogether guided and animated by
memories. In the same year the Governor of Honan
submitted a petition from the gentry and inhabitants of
the town of Wensiang, in which they prayed for permission
to erect a memorial temple to the late intendant
of their circuit. This town, it seems, borders upon
the Yellow River, from the ravages of which it had
suffered terribly for a long succession of years. Two
years before a movement was started by the local
magistrate and the people for building a breakwater
to serve as a barrier against the floods. "The Taotai,
in whose jurisdiction the place was situated, took an
active interest in the enterprise, and even went frequently
in person to superintend the progress of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
work. The great difficulty experienced was the want
of sufficiently large stones. Greatly to the astonishment
of the whole community, a heavy storm of wind and
rain deluged the country, and brought down an endless
quantity of huge stones exactly suited to the purpose.
The people naturally regarded the strange occurrence
as a direct manifestation of divine power in aid of a
great public undertaking, which they and their forefathers
had been unable to complete during several
centuries. The Taotai fell a victim to fatigue and
over-exertion, and his death was deeply bewailed by
the whole district. The Governor, in supporting the
petition, mentioned a fact which proves the supernatural
origin of the phenomenon. One of the stones, which
was as large as a house, and shaped like a tortoise,
was inscribed with seal characters, only two of which,
denoting 'work' and 'stone' respectively, could be
made out. The breakwater was completed, and the
safety of the district secured. As a token of their
gratitude for the services of the Taotai, the petitioners
begged that they might be permitted to erect a temple
to his memory, at which the usual sacrifices should be
offered.&mdash;<i>Granted by Rescript.</i>"</p>

</div>

<p>But it is not only public benefactors and deserving
officials who are rewarded by memorials. Deserving
deities or patron saints also meet with recognition.
Thus in 1891 an application was made to the Throne
for two Imperial tablets, bearing his Majesty's sign-manual,
to be suspended in the temples of the dragon-king
and the god of fire at Chiwan-chow. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
latter district, consisting of six villages, which contribute
to the Exchequer some 10,000 taels, had no
proper water system, and was entirely dependent for
its supply of that precious commodity on the periodical
rains. Of late years, whenever rain had not fallen in
due season, prayers offered up at these two shrines
had ever been graciously answered. Moreover, in the
seventh moon of the previous year, just when the crops
were ready for harvesting, a heavy fall of rain came on,
and threatened to submerge the fields. But a visit on
the part of the gentry and people of the neighbourhood
to the temple of the god of fire had the effect
of dissipating the clouds and causing the rain to cease,
so that the grain could be gathered in in due season.
Two months later, when about to sow the second crop,
a thorough soaking rain was necessary to prepare the
ground for the seed; but for days no rain fell, and the
people greatly feared that they would be unable to sow.
A visit to the temple of the dragon-king, however, had
the desired effect, and dispelled all gloomy prospects
of a dearth of food.</p>

<p>It was in recognition of these gracious favours of
the gods that the memorialist ventured to prefer this
request, which was accordingly granted. Many people
may laugh at this. It seems to me rather an act of
faith of which we might find many parallels in Europe
in the Middle Ages, and of which individually I
should be glad to find further examples now. "Whom
we ignorantly worship" will be a true description of
man's part as long as he lives upon this earth with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
darkened eyes. But it is only when he ceases to worship
that there seems to be little hope for him. There
is little enough of worship in China as it is, and what
there is naturally seems to us of Europe somewhat
superstitious; for the religions of China appear to
have had their day, to have effected what they could
for China, and to be passing away. Is it true that
the youthful Emperor Kwang-shü was considering with
his adviser Kang whether Christianity should not be
adopted as the national religion, when he was precipitated
from the throne by the woman who rules
China single-mindedly for her own advantage?</p>

<p>That crime is not very rife in China is sufficiently
shown by their having no police force. Foreigners
are sometimes shocked by the severity of Chinese
punishments, not realising that it is our excellent police
that enable us to mitigate our scale of punishments.
But the Chinese are like women in this respect also.
They afford an extraordinarily small percentage of
criminals to the world's criminal roll, and of these the
most part are for petty theft. In business dealings,
unlike the Japanese, the Chinese keep to their word,
even when it is to their own disadvantage to do so.
And merely saying, "Puttee book," without any signed
and sealed written entry, held good as a legal transaction
all through China, till, alas! an old-established English
firm, probably already foreboding the failure that afterwards
overwhelmed it, repudiated a transaction of which
there was no further record than the till then two
sacred words. Since then Chinese, like other nations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
have recourse to written documents; but so high always
is the sense of business obligation among them, that
each China New Year many men, unable to discharge
their obligations, commit suicide rather than live disgraced.
This is the more remarkable among a nation
that adulterates everything it knows how to, resorts
to every business subterfuge, thinks not to lie foolish,
and to be found out only stupid, not disgraceful.
When, however, we denounce Orientals for want of
truth, do we realise how untruthful we are ourselves,
and that what shocks us is rather the different kind of
falsity from that to which we are accustomed? I have
yet to find the English bootmaker or worker in fur,
who can be relied upon to keep to his word as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the day on which he has promised anything; whilst
I have met with more than one Chinese tailor, who
may be relied upon to appear with his work finished
to the very day and hour, his given word being sacred
to him. The English tradesman thinks it wrong to
lie about the past, the Chinese about the future.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0223" id="i_0223"></a>
<img src="images/i_0223.jpg" width="505" height="385" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SHOES TO MEND.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most remarkable things about Chinese
is that, whilst of course it is usual for people of other
nationalities to denounce their bad qualities as a nation,
there is hardly a European living in China who has
not one or more Chinese whom he would trust with
everything, whom he would rely upon in sickness or
in danger, and whom he really&mdash;if he spoke out, as we
so seldom do&mdash;regards as the embodiment of all the
virtues in a way in which he regards no European of
his acquaintance. We rarely believe in one another's
Chinaman; but we are each of us absolutely convinced
of the fidelity, trustworthiness, <i>and</i> shrewdness of
our own particular Chinaman. Whilst among missionaries
life in China is generally sweetened by the
recollection of some one Chinaman, at least, whose
sincerity and holiness of life shine out to them as
a bright example and beautiful memory.</p>

<p>The merchants look askance at the missionaries'
saints, and missionaries are very suspicious of the
merchants' business employés and butlers. But a
nation, that all through the land produces men, who
so thoroughly satisfy their employers, cannot be called
a decadent race; nor, indeed, are any of the signs of
decadence with which I am acquainted to be discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
among the great Chinese people, who appear always
hard-working, good-humoured, kindly, thrifty, law-abiding,
contented, and in the performance of all duties
laid upon them astonishingly conscientious. I have
never known a servant shirk any task imposed upon
him, because he was tired or ill, or because it was
late at night. Let unexpected guests arrive, the
Chinese servant always rises to the occasion, and the
honour of the family is safe in his hands. "Oh, but
we have always heard Chinese were good servants,"
some one remarks. Let me relate a story of another
kind of virtue!</p>

<p>A Hunan man living at Hankow, and a Christian,
was greatly troubled because his wife would bind their
little girl's feet. At last he sent the child away to an
American mission-school at a distance. While she was
there, a great wave of anti-footbinding enthusiasm
passed over the school, and all the girls unbound their
feet, his daughter among them. When she came home,
he was delighted to find her able to walk, and to stand
on her feet, and with healthy, rosy cheeks. After a
while, however, he became aware that each day she
was walking worse, and that it must be that once more
her mother was inflicting the torture of binding upon
her, worse than ever now the girl was older. Yet
they had so often gone over the matter together with
always the same result, that he shrank from remonstrating
with his wife, till one day in a neighbouring
cottage a woman said: "A nice one you are to talk,
you who are seeing your own daughter daily lamed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
before your eyes!" Then he went home, and said
to his wife: "This thing must have an end. Not only
have I the pain of seeing my daughter daily lamed,
but I can no longer speak out for God; my mouth
is stopped by your handiwork." His wife replied, as
so often before: "If you will cut off your queue, I
will unbind our daughter's feet&mdash;yes, and my own too."
"Do you mean what you say?" he asked quietly.
Again and again she repeated her declaration that
they must conform to custom if he did, and that if
he gave it up so would they; regarding it always as
a thing impossible that he should part with that glory
of a Chinaman, his long, glossy, plaited tail of hair.
At last, when she had said it seven times, each time
with increasing vehemence, her husband took up the
large pair of Chinese scissors lying on the table, and
there and then before her astonished eyes cut off his
queue. The neighbours, in horror at what he had
done, carried it off, and in high excitement proceeded
to unroll it like a great black serpent at the feet of
one of the missionaries, who at first thought the Hunan
man must have been in such violent anger as to lose
all control over himself, or he would never have done
what he had. But the man explained that it was not
in anger, but because he saw no other way to save
his child, having all in vain tried argument and entreaty
with his wife. "It is true it is contrary to the law of
the land," he said; "but it is better I should offend
against that than offend against my God." When I
last saw him, he had the shock of upstanding hair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
that generally indicates in a Chinaman a desire to add
to his queue. His wife had unbound her feet, and
their daughter's feet had never been bound again.
When last heard of, the three had all been out for a
walk together. But people must have lived in China
to know what heroism this sacrifice of a pigtail really
means. So far it has had no imitators, and other
Chinese hearing of it remain simply astounded.</p>

<p>Before dismissing this subject of morals, it is as well
to add that any Englishwoman marrying a Chinaman
in England would do well to ascertain first that he was
unmarried, which is most unlikely, as a Chinese father
considers it a disgrace not to find a wife for his son
so soon as he is marriageable. Further, that even
where this is the case, the life that would lie before
an English girl married to a Chinaman, if he were to
take her into real Chinese life, is such as one does not
like to contemplate: she must in any case prepare to
become the servant of her mother-in-law. In December,
1898, there were, however, four young English girls,
the youngest only seventeen, brought out by mail-steamers
as the wives of Chinamen, and deserted in
Shanghai, all without money, one even without clothes.
Whilst sorry for the girls, I must own that in cases
like this I feel more indignation against their parents
than against the Chinamen. There is a degree of
carelessness that seems worse than a crime.

<p>Directly that, leaving behind steamers, railways,
<i>and</i> Sundays, you step ashore at Ichang, a
thousand miles up the river Yangtse, you find yourself
in the land of superstition. Right opposite to Ichang,
facing it from across the river, stands a pyramidal
mountain six hundred feet high, in all its proportions
resembling the Pyramid of Cheops. The people of
Ichang say it menaces them, and, according to their
belief in <i>Fung shui</i>, or climatic influences (literally, wind
and water), prevents their young men from passing
their examinations, and makes all their wealth pass into
the pockets of strangers. Just before I first arrived
there in 1887, they had all taxed themselves, and built
a many-storied temple on the top of the very highest
hill behind the city, in order to keep the baleful pyramid
in check; and the subject of conversation amongst the
peasants at that period, when not discussing the price of
something or their last bargain, was always whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
that temple had been built on quite the right spot.
"I always said it ought to be on that other knoll, and
turned a little more aslant," one would say. However,
though they have not yet grown rich, probably to be
accounted for by some error of the kind, two of their
young men the very next year after the building of
this temple took their second degree&mdash;an event which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
had not gladdened the neighbourhood for hundreds of
years.</p>

<p class="caption">ICHANG FROM THE CITY WALL, HALL OF LITERATURE, AND PYRAMID HILL.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is very easy for us to laugh at <i>Fung shui</i>; but
it often strikes me that far more foolish than the
Chinese belief is the absolute disregard of climatic
influences shown in England. When the huge block
of Queen Anne Mansions was building, I recollect
applying for south rooms; and noticing the late Mr.
Hankey's expression as he jotted down a memorandum,
I asked him what he had been writing. "Oh, only
about five or six people have applied for south rooms,"
he said. "So I put you down as one of the eccentric
lot. You'll find them hot, you know, in the season."
I ventured to remark that the sun went northwards
in summer; but Mr. Hankey was incredulous. Applying
to a house agent in London for a small house with a
south aspect, he said he really could not tell me of any
off-hand, as he had never been asked for such a thing
before, and had no notion how the houses on his list
faced. But, stranger than this, when house-hunting
with friends in the lovely Caterham district some years
ago, we found that whenever we drove up to a house
in high hopes, seeing it was situated on such an
eminence as to command a really lovely view, we
invariably found the house turned its back on the view,
which often could not be seen from any of the windows.
Although the Chinese in the course of centuries have
made <i>Fung shui</i> into a superstition, surely their consideration
of aspects, soils, water, etc., is wiser than
our disregard of all such potent influences of nature?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
It is, however, always easier to laugh than to learn;
and I see that I noted at the time:</p>

<p>"The other day, such a tumult here! It turned out
that some of the neighbours disapproved of the gable-end
just added to the servants' quarters of our new
house. A number of old women insisted on dragging
my husband into their houses to see. 'Look!' they
said, 'your new gable points! and points straight at our
shrine. It will ruin us.' Greatly amused, he straightway
said, 'It shall be curled in another direction as soon
as possible.' The old women were at once propitiated
and delighted. But so far it has not yet been curled,
and they seem to have forgotten all about it."</p>

<p>In other countries besides China an assurance that
a thing is to be done quite satisfies people.</p>

<p><i>Fung shui</i> was the great obstacle to the erection
of telegraph-posts, and is a difficulty in the making of
railroads; but it seems to be easily overcome by an
official assurance that the interference with it is of
no consequence. The carefully chosen sites for houses
show, however, how deep-rooted it is in the national
life, the most unfortunate fact about it being that in
their solicitude for the dead the Chinese generally
assign the very best spots to graves, which must never
be meddled with except at a change of dynasty; and,
unfortunately, when the Manchu Dynasty came in, they
omitted to level the graves. It would be almost worth
while to have another change of dynasty, if only for
the purpose of restoring to the use of the living much
of the best ground in China.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>A stranger Chinese belief is that when the ph&oelig;nix
and dragon of fable come together an egg is laid
which leads to the devastation of the country. Such
an egg was said to have been hatched at Matung,
a little way below Chungking on the river. Certainly,
the city magistrate went down to inspect the spot.
It is the duty of all the officials to destroy these
eggs all over China, their whereabouts being discoverable
by the snow refusing to lie over them. But
as we have mostly no snow in Chungking, perhaps
that was held as an excuse for the officials; for we
did not hear of any being beheaded or otherwise
punished for letting the egg be hatched. The magistrate,
indeed, refused to be drawn on the subject and say
what he actually saw. "All nonsense, all nonsense!"
he said. One curious part of it was that we never
should have heard of his visit and its object but for
noting the extraordinarily heavy rain that seemed to
pour and pour over Matung. We were many of us
dwellers on the hill-tops that summer&mdash;though not at
all after Mr. Grant Allen's fashion, I fancy; and one
of our daily entertainments was to watch the thunderstorms
marching along the lower country, investing first
one mountain, then another, dividing here, converging
there. And one could not but notice how the most
awful thunderstorms passed by all obstacles to concentrate
themselves on Matung. Commenting upon this
as we sat in the starlight in the evening watching our
other entertainment, the play of the lightning, we
remarked it might be worth while to go to Matung to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
see what had happened there, and then were told of
the magistrate's visit to inspect the egg that had been
hatched, and that before all these great storms, which
we had looked down upon at intervals, in a small way
being at times ourselves partakers. There evidently
must therefore have been some striking indication of
coming calamity to call for an official visit; and judging
by what we saw ourselves, that indication had
been realised. "It is the people's own fault, if they
build their houses in a river-bed. Of course they
are washed away," said the magistrate. But how
many were washed away we never knew. One often
regrets the absence of a newspaper in the interior of
China. Twice in one week we saw in the distance great
fires&mdash;saw the flames rise up, towering like a bonfire,
spread, then after some time die out, a blackness
settling down on what one imagines were once happy
homesteads. In England, next morning we should
be reading all the particulars; next day would follow the
subscription list, after we had already sent our cast-off
clothes, etc., to the sufferers. Thus would our
sympathies be called forth at the same time that
our interests were aroused. In China&mdash;nothing! No
more is heard of the conflagration we even ourselves
witness, of the inundation to which we also&mdash;at
least, our hill-tops did their part&mdash;may be said to
have contributed. Is it not partly this that makes
life in China so dull? Is it possibly this also which
leaves denizens in China looking so much younger
than their years, their faces unmarked by the traces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
of emotion experienced, whether pleasurable or the
reverse?</p>

<p>Materialistic though our worthy <i>compradores</i> (business
managers) and invaluable boys (butlers) appear to
us, with their expressionless faces and highly coloured
explanations of popular beliefs in racy pigeon English,
yet in reality no people believe themselves more surrounded
by spirits than do the Chinese. Unfortunately,
their spirits are generally evil spirits, requiring cunning
handling to frustrate their designs&mdash;as when at
New Year's time you stick on your door a red paper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
announcing that some sage of old or other celebrity lives
in this house. In all countries the general belief seems
to have been that the devils are very easily outwitted.
But it is noteworthy how this belief in evil spirits gains
upon the foreigners in their midst. Dr. Nevius, one
of the most high-minded and noblest missionaries I have
come across, a delightful man of apparently most healthy
mind in a healthy body, wrote a deeply interesting
volume on <i>Demon Possession</i>, giving instances to
prove that this still exists in all its old Biblical terrors
in China. I have known another missionary who is
under the belief that by heartfelt prayer he himself
was instrumental in driving out a demon; also others,
of good social position and first-class English education,
who felt their own powers for good almost paralysed
whilst in the west of China by the presence of active
evil spirits. Nor have I been able to divest myself
in certain temples of the belief that the air was full
of them, though I spent a long, long summer's day
there once, alone, trying either to dispel the idea or
to determine that it was so. Matters like these, if we
believe, we none of us like to speak about. Certainly,
it is during residence in China&mdash;supposed generally to
have such a materialising effect&mdash;that I have become
so convinced of spiritual agencies as to believe this
faith unshakable. Happily for me the spirits, of whose
presence and help I cannot doubt, have been uniformly
good. And believing in their care, it has been impossible
for me to be afraid in many circumstances with
regard to which people often ask, "Were you not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
frightened?" Yet I have been frightened, very much
frightened too, at other times. Probably, to many this
confession will seem to rob my account of all trustworthiness.
But all through this volume I try to write
down what I have seen or think of things, always
without asserting the correctness of my views. Some
day we shall know; meanwhile, "It seems so to me"
appears to be the truest phrase with reference to
things Chinese.</p>

<p>To pass to lighter beliefs. In the west of China,
at the foot of every fine old hoangko-tree, <i>Ficus
infectoria</i>, a kind of banyan, is a little stone shrine,
showing how at one time reverence was entertained
for the spirit of this very beautiful shade-tree, growing
on the top of so many hills in the windless province
of Szechuan, always alone, and often giving enough
shade to shelter the whole village near it under its
branches in summer evenings; whilst in the autumn
in the east of China, when the air is full of floating
masses of gossamer, the Chinese say it is the "thread
of <i>niang-niang</i>," or "heavenly silk." By the wayside,
everywhere throughout China, the traveller comes upon
pretty little shrines with one or two incense-sticks
giving out a sweet fragrance; and if ever the whole
land is converted to a higher, purer faith, I cannot but
hope that these graceful little shrines may not be done
away with, but consecrated anew with a figure of the
Virgin Mother and Infant Saviour, or a crucifix, or
a figure of some high and holy man of old, an ensample
to us of these latter days, that so, like as in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
neighbourhood of Méran, the peasant may feel called
to offer upon it his beautiful white gardenia flowers, or
a bunch of pink azaleas from the mountain-side, or
a blossom of the gorgeous red dragon-claw flower,
or even a white tea blossom or wild camellia, and, so
doing, pray to Him above all, Whom they, as we, believe
even now to see all they do, and Who, whatever our
belief about Him, must for ever remain the same.</p>

<p>But I am wandering again and again into the sacred
groves of religion, and must return into the devious
paths of superstition. When a cargo-boat of my
husband's once became a complete wreck, he could not
help, even under the depressing influence of the news,
being amused to hear his Chinese manager saying:
"They would do it. They would do it. I told them
not to. We must never again carry a cargo of dried
shrimps. Of course, their spirits spoke to the spirits
of their brother-fishes in the river, and they raised
the waves that they might jump up and release their
imprisoned relations. Well, there's a good deed done:
a lot of lives set free. But we must not take shrimps
again. You see, it is a dead loss. And I said so from
the first."</p>

<p class="caption">THE 564 IMAGES OF HANGCHOW.</p>
</div>

<p>According to a Chinese paper, the inhabitants of
Chaochow Fu, of which Swatow is the seaport, are
very superstitious. When one of them is seriously ill,
instead of getting a doctor to attend him, he invites
a certain set of priests to perform jugglers' feats and
recite mysterious incantations. Thereby, it is believed,
a cure can be effected. Ascending a ladder of swords
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
is considered a very effectual mode of treatment. Two
thirty-feet poles are made to stand in an upright
position, fixed firmly in the ground parallel to each
other. One hundred and twenty sharp swords, with
their keen edges upward, are tied to the two poles
like the rungs of a ladder. Some days before the
ceremonies are to be performed notices are freely
distributed, and on the given day thousands gather
for the sight. A young priest, dressed in a fantastic
costume, advances to the foot of the ladder, chanting
incantations, and making passes with a knife which he
holds in his hand. Suddenly he steps on the sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
edges of the swords forming the rungs of the ladder,
and climbs rapidly. As the young priest has bare
feet, it is a wonder that he can step without being
injured on the edges of the swords. When he reaches
the highest point, he deliberately sits on a sword, and
throws down a rope. The sick man's clothing is tied
to this, and is drawn up to the top. The young priest
then shakes the clothing to the winds, burns magical
scrolls, and recites incantations. He cries aloud the
name of the patient, who is called in such ceremonies,
"Redeem the soul." After these performances, the
clothing is let down, and the patient puts it on. Taking
a piece of red cloth from his pocket, the young priest
waves it over his head like a flag, at the same time
dancing and leaping from one pole to another. He
places several sheets of paper money on the edges of
the swords, steps on them, and the sheets fly in all
directions, cut in the centre. He thus shows that the
weapons are sharp, and that his position is by no
means an enviable one. Exhausting himself at last,
he descends with all the agility at his command.
"Sometimes under such treatment the patient manages
to recover," adds the Chinese paper naïvely enough.</p>

<p>In 1890 such a curious account was given in the
<i>North China Daily News</i> of an incident that had
just occurred in Western Shantung, the province the
Germans are now trying to make their own, that, as
I know nothing further of it, I think it is better to
extract it from the paper:</p>

<p>"A certain man had a daughter, who was an only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
child, and for whose life the parents entertained the
greatest fears. A boy, to be sure, would have been
much more precious; but, as the saying runs, 'When
cinnabar is not to be had, even red earth is valuable.'
Having a neighbour named Chang who had many
daughters, it occurred to the parents of the solitary
child that it would be a good plan to have her 'adopted'
into the family of the man with several daughters as
one of them. This 'adoption,' it must be understood,
is a pure fiction, and consists in nothing more than in
calling the adopted child by the <i>surname</i> of the family
into which she is adopted. Thus, in this case, the
parents' surname being Liu, the girl, who was a mere
infant, was called 'Chang Four,' as a milk-name,
denoting that she was technically number four in the
Chang family series of girls. The evil fates, perceiving
that the Chang family had such a supply of daughters,
would let her grow up in peace, and thus the Liu
family would contrive to outwit the malignant spirits!
The Liu girl never went to the Chang family to live,
and had no relations with them of any kind, except
that the family exchanged presents and calls on feast
days, as if the conditions were those of a betrothal.
In fact, the Chang family would be styled by the
Liu family as their 'adopted relatives by marriage.'
Devices of this kind, to cheat the fates in regard
to boys, are very common, the lads being called
'<i>ya-t`ao</i>,' for girl, or sometimes '<i>lao-p`o</i>,' to indicate
that they are old married women. But these cunning
schemes cannot, however, always be regarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
complete successes; for in this case the only daughter
died, and so the 'dry relationship' came to an end."</p>

<p>Around the god of literature all kinds of legends
have crystallised. He is said to have lived through
seventeen lives. He is also said in his own person
to have completed the perfection of the three religions
of China. He did all manner of marvellous things,
besides driving away a tiger that threatened a
messenger, under promise from the latter to distribute
five thousand copies of the tract on rewards and punishments.
Perhaps the Psychical Society might learn
something from his chapter on ghosts:</p>

<p>"A ghost is the corrupt part of man, and man is
the pure part of a ghost.</p>

<p>"A man can be a ghost, and a ghost can be a man.
The man and the ghost are mutually related. Why
separate man and ghost?</p>

<p>"The ghost becomes a man, then man must become
a ghost.</p>

<p>"If a man does not become a ghost, he will surely
be able to perfect manhood.</p>

<p>"It is difficult for a ghost to become a man, because
it has fallen to ghosthood, and because it has lost
manhood.</p>

<p>"A man is a ghost; a ghost is a man: but all men
are not ghosts, neither is every ghost a man.</p>

<p>"Those who can be respectful without feeling
ashamed, who can be submissive without deception,
who can obey to perfection the rule of life, and are
able to preserve their natural force unabated, secretly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
cherishing growth, will become Buddhas or Genii, and
not ghosts."</p>

<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Probably a great deal is lost in this translation; but
the phrase to be "submissive without deception" is
certainly noteworthy.</p>

<p>The god of war has not passed through so many
vicissitudes; but it seems that in his lifetime he was
a merchant noted for probity and liberality, and it is
in this character that his picture is to be found in all
self-respecting business firms to this day as an example
of what a merchant should be. Then as the centuries
passed by, he was canonised as the god or guardian
saint of war, and his last change was being made
the tutelary deity of the present dynasty. It is a great
question, however, whether the Chinese can properly
be said to have either gods or idols, or whether it
would not be more correct to say they make and set
up images of men canonised as guardian saints, and
whose spirits are supposed to be present where proper
reverence is shown to their images. According to
Dr. Edkins, at the feasts in honour of the dead, whether
simply ancestors or famous men of old, the dead man
is now represented by a tablet; but by ancient rules
a living representative was required, and preferably
a grandson. In the time of the Hia Dynasty he stood.
Under the Shang Dynasty&mdash;from 1800 to 1200 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>&mdash;he
sat. Under the Chow Dynasty there would be six
representatives of the deceased ancestors, who were
all treated as guests, and partook of the feast. They
had the strange idea that only thus could the patriarch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
of the clan be kept from extinction; for they thought of
the soul as breath, liable to be dispersed as air. They
called such a representative of the dead "the corpse,"
or, more correctly, "the image of the soul." It is hard
to say whether such a practice is more material or
spiritual.</p>

<p>Mencius describes images as at first made of grass
and rushes, and then of wood, "to be buried with the
dead in order to provide the deceased with servants
to wait upon him in the other world." But not in his
writings, nor in any of the classics, are there any indications
of worshipping images or idolatry. Probably
these images were a survival of human sacrifices in
more ancient times. Paper representations of houses,
servants, horses, money, are now burnt at stated festivals,
in order to supply the dead with all they need. And
for about a month before the appointed day, all through
China, the eldest grandson of each family may be seen
busy making out lists of all the ancestors entitled to
such gifts, and writing letters to be burnt with them.
Then on the appointed day the feast is spread, chopsticks
are placed, wine-cups are filled, all for the dead
dear ones. Thus are the superstitions or religious
observances of the Chinese knit with their every-day
life; for the living in the end eat the feast, though the
wine is commonly poured out upon the ground as a
libation. Then comes the great day when all the family
goes out as a great picnic party to the family graves.
The best clothes are put on, and a long day is spent
in the country in junketing and gossip. All the environs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
of a Chinese city&mdash;for the environs are always the graveyards&mdash;are
alive with gaily dressed parties of people,
till the appearance presented is that of a great fair; for
naturally booths are erected for the sale of eatables and
drinkables as well as of offerings all along by the
wayside. The temples are crowded; the priests receive
offerings. Every one goes home at night with much
the same expression as English people after a Bank
Holiday. On the whole, the Chinese festival appears
the holier and more fraught with sentiment of the two.
Naturally, this festival is the culminating-point of
ancestral worship. But it does not seem difficult to see
how reverence for ancestors might be made altogether
Christian, the natural outcome of the fourth commandment;
nor how these feasts for the dead might be made
very much the same as the Jour des Morts in Paris,
or, indeed, something higher and yet more Christian.
They are inextricably knit with the belief that the dead
father's spirit floats round and watches over his children
after death; and thus is the principle of <i>noblesse oblige</i>,
or respect for ancestors, carried into every, even the
poorest, household of China.

<p>People can hardly fairly discuss the question of
missionaries without deciding definitely first of
all whether they wish the Chinese to become Christians
or not. And as I do not know what may be the views
of those who read this book, I think I had better
here cite impressions as to the prejudice against them,
written after I had only spent a few years in the East;
for the prejudice against missionaries is really one of
the most amusing things in China.</p>

<p>"They all hang about Chefoo. That is the sort of
place that suits them. A nice comfortable house, and
nothing to do! Just about suit me too! I'd like to
find a merchant's clerk who did as little as one of
these <i>self-devoted</i> men, who have given up everything,"
is a little speech I heard one man make to three
others one day, apparently expressing the sentiments
and experience of all. Yet take Chefoo, the very place
thus pointed out, and what do you find there? There is
not a Shanghai man who knows him who does not say:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
"Oh, Dr. Nevius! Oh! but he's quite an exceptional
man. He does more good than all the others put
together, I believe. You don't fancy other missionaries
are like him?" Or, "Oh, Dr. Williamson! Oh! but
that's a man quite unlike the common," or, as I heard
another day, "That's a man one really likes to hear
talk about religion."</p>

<p class="caption">MISSIONARY GROUP AT OUR HOUSE-WARMING.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is just the same, if you go up Hankow way.
"Mr. Barber! Ah! but he is a thorough gentleman!
A University man! Seventeenth Wrangler, you know,
and a splendid all-round man&mdash;good at cricket, and football,
and everything." "Mr. Hill! You won't meet
another man like him in a hurry. Why, he is a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
of independent means; doesn't draw a penny from the
Mission. There is hardly a good cause all over the
world which that man does not give to. He is wearing
himself out, though"; or if the speaker be a little
enthusiastic&mdash;they are enthusiastic sometimes in the
outports: "That man is a real apostle."</p>

<p>Then again: "You don't know who that man is?
Why, he was the champion wrestler till he came out
here on mission work&mdash;wore the Border belt for two
years. Some of the young bloods in Shanghai thought
a missionary couldn't do much, and challenged him when
he first came out. Didn't he punish them, though, and
said, 'You see I am trying not to hurt you!' Why,
he could have broken every bone in their bodies, if
he had let himself."</p>

<p>Or again: "Mr. John! Now that man does real
good. He has worked away for years, and every one
must respect him. His is real solid work."</p>

<p>Then again, Mr. Baller of Ngankin. He is only
to be named for every one who knows him to burst
out into a eulogy. Mr. Studd's cricket renown is too
widely spread not to make him exceptional from the
outset; but those who have come across him in China
seem already to have found out other things yet more
noteworthy about him.</p>

<p>Thus the conversation goes on about pretty well
every missionary any one knows anything about; and
yet it winds up as it began: "But the missionaries
generally are quite different,&mdash;hang about and make
believe&mdash;and save money&mdash;and go home!" These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
typical missionaries no one seems to have ever met;
yet every one who has been to China must agree one
hears plenty about them. It begins on the voyage
out, when you are told about the poor girls&mdash;the
enthusiastic, misguided young girls they lure out to
wretchedness, nobody knows where. "Clap them into
Chinese dress the moment they arrive, and send them
off up-country, where there is not a single European,
in carts and all sorts of miserable conveyances. That's
what they do. Why, the poor girls don't know themselves
where they are going to."</p>

<p>This is the oft-repeated tale. And it is certainly
highly probable that newly arrived missionaries, whether
men or women, cannot pronounce the name of the place
they are going to, nor even at first remember it. But
there seemed some sound common sense in what an
elder missionary said the other day: "Youth enables
women to bear many hardships, under which they
would break down in later life. And youthful enthusiasm
carries many a young missionary over the first
two years of Chinese life, where a woman of forty
could not bear the change of climate and food.
Besides, if, as is most likely, they become the wives
of missionaries, there is a far more reasonable hope of
a happy married life when the wife is already well
accustomed to China and its ways before undertaking
the cares and duties of a wife, than when she
is brought out fresh from England and has to face all
together."</p>

<p>However, Shanghai so far keeps up its old character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
for gallantry, that it never has a word to say against
the lady missionaries, unless sometimes in a grumbling
tone: "Did you ever really see a pretty one?" But,
then, every one has. Captains speak rather sorrowfully
of this, that, and the other who came out with them.
And young men who go to church (young Shanghai
does go to church a little; it is the men past their prime
who only "have seats"),&mdash;young Shanghai speaks sentimentally
of some fair apparition who looked so lovely
in loose-fitting white and blue, and begins to question
whether Chinese dress is not, after all, the most becoming.
Certainly, fair hair looks all the fairer and softer above
the loose-fitting clothes more generally associated with
coarsest black.</p>

<p>And all the while the missionaries come in increasing
numbers. With each freshly arriving steamer the cry
is, "Still they come!" till China promises fair to be the
best spiritually seen after country outside Christendom.
Yet no missionary ever comes to the Europeans,
whose spirituality seems to have so withered for want
of exercise, that they resent nothing more than the idea
that they could want a missioner to minister to their
spiritual necessities or perchance have no spiritual wants.</p>

<p>Yet no account of Shanghai would be other than
most incomplete which did not treat of the missionaries.
They are a set apart, well known to one another, unknown
for the most part to other Europeans, full of
information about the China towns and Chinese generally,
and abounding in racy anecdotes. How much
good they do, who can estimate? They are certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
most refreshing to meet with, having a purpose in life,
and reminding us sometimes that, as Faber says,
"There are souls in this world that have the gift of
finding joy everywhere."</p>

<p>But not all. The climate is trying; Chinese society
is not of the liveliest; and there are&mdash;of course there
always must be&mdash;a certain number of missionaries who
do not seem quite the right kind of persons to have
come out. How should it be otherwise? But it is a
question whether that is more the fault of those of the
inferior sort who come, or of those superior people who
stay behind. But, setting aside this vexed question,
the Roman Catholic missionaries do not appear nearly
as cheerful and pleased with their surroundings as the
Protestants. Nor, indeed, does one quite see what they
have to make them happy&mdash;except, of course, always
the love of God.</p>

<p>One time going up-river, after Chinkiang the saloon
presented a picture of pigtailed Frenchmen&mdash;Jesuit
Fathers in white Chinese clothes. As Jesuits are not
allowed to go up-country till after a long preliminary
training, and do not become full Jesuit Fathers till
after at the least eight and not uncommonly fifteen
years of preparation, if they are not far more skilled
missionaries than those of the various denominations
of Protestants, it would seem to show that in spiritual,
unlike carnal, warfare training and discipline avail
nothing. They reckon some one hundred thousand
converts in Kiangnan. In some instances they have
whole villages of Christians; but although Christians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
they say it must be remembered these villages are
Chinese still.</p>

<p>How merrily the French Fathers chatted over their
coffee! But at the one word "France" every man
waxed sorrowful! They say, however, they do not suffer
from <i>mal du pays</i>, as do the Italians, many of whom
have to go home, in consequence, sick with sorrowing.
Not to be forgotten, however, is that French priest
at Peking who, just returned from a long sojourn up-country,
at the one word "France" broke down completely,
and could <i>not</i> recover himself. And once more I
felt a tightening at the heart, thinking of that large house
building at Ichang to receive Italian Sisters&mdash;simple,
loving-hearted women, who for others' sins, not their
own, will live and die so far away from that loved
Italy for which Filicaja wished: "Ah! wert thou but
more strong; or if not that, less fair!" The life of
Italian Sisters in China seems altogether too sad. They
all get sick; they cannot love the people; they long
for Italy; and till now they have been obliged to bind
the feet of the little girls confided to them, yet unable
to bear the pain for them. But the French priests, too,
seem to have nothing to look forward to, and their
lives are more comfortless than certainly English people
at home have any idea of. I recollect one French
priest in a most remote village showing me&mdash;half
excusing himself, half proudly&mdash;his one great luxury,
a little window with glass panes he had put in near his
writing-desk, so as to see to read and write till later
in the evening. There was barely a chair of any kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
to sit down on in his large barracklike room. He
showed me a set of photographs of his native village in
France; but I noticed he never dared glance at it himself
while we were there. We were the first Europeans
to visit the place during the three years he had been
there, with the exception of an old priest, who once
a year came three days' journey across the mountains
to see how he was going on. By comparison, the life
of Protestant missionaries seems so joyous; indeed, I
have never been able to see why it should not be an
exceptionally pleasant one&mdash;barring illnesses always.</p>

<p>The coming New Year was casting its shadow
before it in Chungking in the shape of gaudy pictures
festooned about the streets, crackers of rejoicing by
night and by day, and sad-faced young men wanting to
realise on the family gold ornaments or picture-books
by old masters offered at impossible prices. It cast its
shadow also in other ways. The mission schools were
breaking up, and the missionaries themselves going out
to <i>schwa</i>, i.e. enjoy themselves in the country. Having
been kindly invited to be present at the breaking
up of the Friends' Girls' School, I noticed one or two
things that appear worth recording.</p>

<p>Of course, I know missionary labours are popularly
supposed to be the one kind of work on which we
all of "the world outside" are qualified to pass
discriminating judgment without ourselves requiring
any preparation for so doing. A man may race across
China as fast as he is able, and it is he who knows
whether the missionaries are wasting their efforts on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
ungrateful soil, or whether opium does or does not
disagree with the Chinese constitution, although he
would hesitate to express an opinion on any such
difficult question as whether a certain soil were suited
for growing opium, or whether a merchant would be
well advised to ship hides for the Shanghai market.
Questions like these require specific knowledge. Not
so the question whether missionaries in China are
doing good. Notwithstanding which I must further
premise that, just as when the new railways begin I
individually should not feel in a position to say the
navvies' work was being wasted because I saw no
rails, so I do not feel in a position to say whether even
the missionaries I know best are spending ineffectual
toil because I do not see many Christians.</p>

<p>Judged by this test, indeed, what wanton extravagance
might not the Shanghai Cathedral be pronounced!
To some follower in our friend Dr. Morrison's footsteps
I commend the calculation of the cost of its services to
be divided by the number of converts thereby made.
The sum would probably not be a difficult one, though
the result might not be gratifying. For it costs more
to redeem souls, etc.</p>

<p>But to return to twenty-six little girls, who were
not converts. They passed an examination in the
Old Testament, as it appeared, most creditably, although
the eldest were thirteen. There was no hesitation in
the answers, as one heard them affirming Jezebel was
not a good woman, and telling about the hair by
which Absalom was caught in the tree. And, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
all, Jezebel and Absalom lived nearer to them than
to us, and at least in their own quarter of the world.
It is really odder to hear village children in England
telling about the Old Testament kings, though it seems
odder to hear Chinese children doing so. The younger
children were also examined. Five little round-about
bodies&mdash;for they were pretty well as thick as they were
long&mdash;aged only six, repeated a hymn. Other hymns
were repeated by other little detachments. All this was
not surprising. But I was surprised when the first class,
being led up to an outline map of Africa without names,
called out Congoland, Madagascar, Natal, and the like
as the examiner pointed. They did the same by Asia,
cheeringly shouting out Japan, and equally readily indicating
China. If into these little girls' heads it really
had penetrated that there were other kingdoms in the
world besides their own, they were in so far better
taught than most of the literati of the land, and no
knowledge would seem more to be desired for a Chinaman
just now. After this the usual eye-trying needlework
was exhibited, under protests from the European
teacher that any one's eyes should be so tried, yet in this
she felt obliged to conform to the fashions of the country.</p>

<p>But what struck me most (for it is the one matter
on which I really felt qualified to form an opinion)
was the expressions of the children. They were interesting,
they were attractive, simply because the mind
in them evidently had been aroused, and was working.
The blank, dead-wall Chinese stolidity was gone. What
may be the end of those children, what may be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
outcome of it all, it is not for me to say; nor how
far it is right to teach little girls who are not Christians
Christian hymns. There are plenty of beautiful hymns
they could learn, avoiding those about a Christ for
whom they have no reverence. But one thing is
clear: for good or for evil those little girls are with
their awakened intelligences in a perfectly different
position from those around them; and if their education
is carried further forward&mdash;about which there
are many difficulties in China&mdash;they will be in an increasingly
critical position. And then seems to come
the great danger. If they become Christians, well and
good; they will have the ethics of Christianity to guide
their daily life. But if not, removed from Buddhist
influences, yet more in need of a guide than those
around them, because themselves more susceptible of
outside influences, one feels a certain uneasiness about
them.</p>

<p>The proceedings wound up with what certainly
seemed to give great pleasure: a gift of an article
of clothing for every little girl from one member of
the Mission, and then the great ceremony of choosing.
Little collections of presents, sent out by the Missionary
Helpers' Union, had been carefully sorted out and
arranged upon the table,&mdash;a doll, a needle-book full of
needles, an emery cushion, and a bag perhaps on one;
woollen muffettees and a picture-book on another; and
so on. The little girl who had most marks had first
choice, and so on to the last, who had no choice at
all, said the kindly lady teacher in great distress, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
heart evidently aching for the little one, who must sit
by and see all the best things chosen from before her
eyes. "But she could have got more marks; it is
her own fault," she added indignantly, the severity of
the teacher once more gaining the upper hand; for
this lady, young though she still was, was not a mere
novice, but was teaching in England in a large and
well-known Friends' School in the west country before
ever she came to China, and came to China with the
distinct purpose to teach little girls; into which work
she appeared to put her whole heart, until ill-health
forced her to come home. Some of the little girls had
evidently studied the presents well beforehand, and
came up to choose with their minds made up, making
the Chinese reverence all round and up and down,
then off to their mothers to put their treasures in safe
keeping before going back to their seats. But it was
pretty to see the indecision on some childish faces,
growing redder and redder as first they pressed a
white wool doll to their little bosoms, then fondled
lovingly one in grey silk. All the dolls had been
carefully dressed to suit Chinese notions of etiquette,
with sleeves well down to the wrist, and the longest
possible lace-trimmed drawers under their long dresses.
But one wondered if the little Chinese children would
not have preferred Chinese-clad dolls to nurse.</p>

<p>Anyway, each year, being presented with such useful
and tempting-looking foreign gifts, although certainly
not intended that way, must predispose the little girls
to wish to buy foreign things when they grow up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
recollecting the delight that foreign things gave them as
children. In this way all the trouble of the Missionary
Helpers' Union, formed of children at home, thus early
trained to interest themselves in missions by being
led to work for them, may have commercial results not
dreamed of by the little workers. With its reflections
my account seems nearly as long as the little ceremony.
But I must not omit one feature of it. The Chinese
mothers sat on benches all round, flushing with pride
as their children distinguished themselves, and the
Mission ladies sat in front behind the prizes. Then in
came all the Mission babies, with their faces so startlingly
clean by comparison with the Chinese as to look
like beings from another sphere, rosy, and kicking
about their white fleecy shawls and other pure whitenesses.
Disdainful, indeed, the babies appeared, and
were themselves probably the crowning feature of the
show; for the Chinese certainly delight in foreign babies,
and are never tired of examining them. I cannot
emulate <i>An Australian through China</i>, and reckon up
the cost per head; but I think the whole proceeding
must have resulted in a certain amount of friendly
feeling, and some of joy. Can we confidently
say even as much of the Marlborough-Vanderbilt
wedding?</p>

<p>There is, however, besides the climate, another sad
element in life in China, and that is the dislike of
the Chinese to foreigners and distrust of them.</p>

<p class="caption">SOOCHOW, WITH MISSION CHURCH.</p>
</div>

<p>It was sad to hear, shortly after this prize-giving,
that there were again anti-foreign placards out on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
the walls of
Chengtu, the
capital of the
province, of a
very violent
description,
and that the
Canadian Mission
had already
been
more than once
the object of
hostilities in a
small way.
Yet one would
like to know
whether in
their new
buildings they
were consulting
Chinese
taste, or building
some
hideous European
erection
which must offend the æsthetic feelings of every Chinaman
that sees it. In this city of beautiful roof-curves a
foreign house, without any proportion being observed
between its windows and wall space, without any
sweep of overhanging eaves, and built as no architect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
European or Chinese, would build it, strikes a dissonance
like a wrong note in music, and must be very irritating
to those attuned from childhood to the laws of beauty
in architecture. Why we should insist upon the Chinese
swallowing our ugly clothes and ugly houses before
they receive our beautiful gospel of glad tidings, I
never can understand, except by reminding myself that
that gospel never came from Shanghai or New York,
but from that very Asia where still truth and beauty
seem to Asiatics synonymous and interchangeable.</p>

<p>The views of the Chinaman, who has done more
than any man of this generation to stir up anti-foreign
feeling among his countrymen, are more to the point,
however, than any words of mine. Chou-han has for
years been circulating tracts of so offensive a nature
against Christians that I cannot further refer to them;
but here is Chou-han's own letter on the subject to
T`an, the Governor of Hupeh. It is interesting, in
connection with this letter, to remember that it was
T`an's son who was among the first six beheaded
by order of the Empress-Dowager when she deposed
her nephew, the Emperor, and that T`an, the father,
either died of grief or killed himself, heartbroken on
hearing of his son's death.</p>

</div>

<p>This is Chou-han's letter to him:</p>

<p class="left65 p2">
"<i>October 30th, 1891.</i></p>

<p class="i2">"<span class="smcap">Venerable and Respected Sir.</span></p>

<p>"Multiplicity of affairs leaves me but little leisure
for letter-writing, and it is a long time since I have
written to inquire after your health. I would humbly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
congratulate you on the ten thousand happinesses which
attend your downsitting and uprising, and on the abundance
of your virtuous deeds and meritorious achievements.
With regard to the anti-heresy publications, let
me state that they are all of them printed and disseminated
by myself, in concert with the officials and gentry,
both civil and military, who have the management of
affairs connected with the Benevolent Halls. Some time
ago a relative of mine, T`ang Chenpih, styled Mungliang,
a native of Siangtan, was going to Wuchang, and
we unitedly entrusted him with a hamperful of these
publications for general distribution. After this a special
messenger was sent by T`ang to Siangtan, to inform
us that he was imprisoned on account of what he had
been doing, and praying that we would come to his
rescue, etc., etc. This is amazing! If, indeed, it be
wrong to attack this depraved heresy, then I am, so
far as the matter of fabricating words and creating
disturbances is concerned, the chief culprit. In all
reason, you ought to report me to the Throne, deprive
me of my official rank, and arrest me as a criminal.
What has my relative T`ang to do with the matter?
And even should you take off his head and hang it up
as a warning to all, how could you by so doing put a
stop to the thing itself?</p>

<p>"My special object in writing now is to beg of
you to consult with the Viceroy, and set at liberty
my relative T`ang and every one of his companions,
who together with him are unjustly implicated; also
to return to them every article of property which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
may have been possibly taken away from them. I
beg of you to prepare a joint statement of facts, and
to impeach me in a memorial. I will respectfully wait
my punishment in the provincial capital; I will certainly
not run away. If however, your Excellencies will treat
good and honest people like fish and pork, and put me
aside and not examine me, then I will go at once to
Peking, and cry at the gate of his Majesty's Palace.
I swear that I will with my own body requite the beneficence
of Yau, Shun, Yu, T`ang, Wen, Wu, Cheu-kung,
Kung, and Meng, together with the beneficence
of his Majesty the Emperor, the Empress-Dowager,
and all the ancestors of the Great Dynasty. I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
certainly not allow my relative T`ang and his injured
companions to hand down a fragrant name to all coming
ages alone. I am anxiously looking for your reply, so
as to decide whether to proceed or to stop. It is for
this I now write, also wishing you exalted enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Your younger brother and fellow-countryman Chou-han
writes with compliments. Chou-han, imperially
honoured with the Second Rank, and expectant Taotai
in Shensi, a native of Ninghiang, now at his own village
recruiting his health."</p>

<p class="left45">
<i>Translated by the Rev. Dr. Griffith John.</i></p>

<p class="p2">One cannot but admire Chou-han for his outspoken
boldness, as also for his persistence in opposing what
he believes to be a depraved heresy. On the other
hand, turning to his tracts, it is difficult to believe that
any one could circulate them with a good intention.</p>

<p>People who do not believe the Chinese would be any
better for becoming Christians can be but little interested
in missionaries. Those who, on the other hand,
really believe we have glad tidings to tell to them may
doubt whether quite the right means are being taken
to deliver the message. If every one who went out to
China lived as a Christian should, it clearly would have
a far more striking effect; but whilst Europe remains
what it is, that seems at least as unattainable as converting
the Chinese. Of those who are converted, I have
come across thousands of Roman Catholics who have
borne the burning of their houses and devastation of
their property. There were four thousand Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Catholic refugees
in Chungking
in the
summer of
1898. Not a
few have been
killed. And
in the west of
China several
cases have occurred
where
men have been
offered their
lives if they
would burn
incense upon
Buddhist altars,
and have
refused and
been martyred.
I do not know
how converts
could more
prove their
sincerity than
by thus dying.
But of Protestant converts, too, I do not think the
staunchness has at all sufficiently been estimated.
When riot after riot occurred all along the Yangtse,
in some cases all the foreigners went away, leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
their converts to shift for themselves. Native evangelists
carried on the services, and there were the
congregations just the same when the missionaries came
back. Whilst, to turn to lesser persecutions, sometimes
even harder to bear, how many Chinese Christians
have seen their business fall away from them, and from
a position of competence have been reduced to poverty!
As long as Treaty Ports exist in China, probably their
common talk will be that Chinese Christians are no
good; for there of all places men of bad character may
be expected to join the Christian communities from
interested motives: but on the whole, though naturally
they cannot attain to all the Christian virtues at once&mdash;it
will probably require a generation or two to arrive
at such an approximation even as we have ourselves
arrived at&mdash;yet in the matter of staunchness Chinese
Christians stand as high as the Christians of any nation
at any age.</p>

</div>

<p>If my opinion, however, be anything worth, and on
this matter I am not the least sure it is, it is not
money so much our missionaries want in the East
as sympathetic upholding. Let them feel that their
countrymen, not missionaries in name, are wishing them
more power, and not taking account of their failures,
and they will be upborne to do greater deeds than
those of old. Would, however, that missionaries may
also believe that those not nominally of their band
may notwithstanding be animated by quite as living
a Christian zeal!</p>

<p>As it is, the way in which missionaries and merchants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
eye each other askance is often very painful. As to
the differences between the sects, I think these are as
much and as needlessly exaggerated as those between
different kinds of Chinese. Chinese converts must be
further advanced in Christianity than is often the case
now to be able to appreciate the difference even between
Roman Catholicism and Congregationalism. They see
there is a difference in ceremonial. But to that Chinese
are much too wise to attach much importance. They
fancy all are "good talkees" of different kinds. And
are they far wrong? The sincerer the Christian the less
importance he always seems to attach to differences
of belief and form.</p>

<p>It is sad to reflect that had there not been such
fierce rivalries between the cardinals in the thirteenth
century, and a consequent Papal interregnum of three
years, Kublai Khan's request to the two brothers Polo
would have probably been acceded to, and the Chinese
become Christians then <i>en masse</i>, after the fashion of
the kindred Russian race. Kublai Khan had "begged
the Pope would send as many as one hundred persons
of our Christian faith; intelligent men, acquainted with
the Seven Arts, well qualified to enter into controversy,
and able clearly to prove by force of argument to
idolaters and other kinds of folk, that the law of Christ
was best, and that all other religions were false and
naught, and that if they would prove this, he and all
under him would become Christians and the Church's
liegemen. Finally, he charged his envoys to bring back
to him some of the oil of the Lamp which burns on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
the sepulchre of our Lord at Jerusalem." There is
a miniature of the fourteenth century of the great
Khan delivering a golden tablet to the brothers. They
started for Rome on this mission with a Tartar Baron,
but he fell sick and went back. They were three years
upon the journey, then delayed, waiting till a Pope,
Gregory of Piacenza, was at last appointed. He sent
two learned Dominicans with them&mdash;two instead of a
hundred&mdash;and these two friars were terrified by a Saracen
outbreak, and turned back in their turn. Again, in the
eighteenth century the Chinese would, it seems, have
become Christians, but that the Dominicans then came
and opposed the Jesuits, who had effected an entrance
in 1580, and had gained great influence over the
Emperor and the nation. The Dominicans and
Franciscans condemned the Jesuit toleration of ancestral
worship, and for the second time China was thrown
back. The Emperor and his advisers were considering
whether Christianity should not be proclaimed the
religion of the country, when the <i>coup d'état</i> came.
Those of the reformers who have survived, and the
Emperor Kwang-shü through them, have thus for
the third time been holding out asking hands to
Christendom.</p>

<p>In all these cases it has been European enlightenment,
as embodied in Christianity, that the Chinese through
their Emperors have asked for. But already we hear
of governors and high officials actually becoming Christians
themselves individually. Up till now none had
certainly joined the Protestant Church, and I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
none had been baptised into the Roman Catholic Church,
for I have always understood in China it was doubted
whether a man could become a Christian and retain
official place.</p>

<p>China has appealed to Christendom for the third
time. May it not be in vain! Of all means for helping
her, the Society for the Diffusion of Christian and
General Knowledge seems the most useful at the
present juncture, and £20 would bring a new city
under its influence, while £200 would enable this
Society to permeate a whole new province with its
revivifying literature.

Year.&mdash;Robbers.&mdash;Protesting Innocence.&mdash;Doing

</div>

<p>Before Chinese New Year bargains are to be
picked up&mdash;in Shanghai lovely embroidered satins,
exquisite transparent tortoiseshell boxes, or china of
the Ming period. Up-country our buyings are of a
different order&mdash;a tiger-skin thirteen feet from head to
tail, with grand markings, though of course not so thick
a fur as is to be had at Newchwang. Head and tail
and claws are all intact; and the man who brings it
exhibits also its terrible jaws, and points to the holes
where the spear entered before the man conquered
the tiger. We have besides stone slabs, with the shells
of the orthoceras embedded in them, sawn asunder and
polished for screens or table-tops. What that most
remarkable animal did, with a shell like the horn of
an unicorn, not uncommonly over two feet long, and
beautifully convoluted, it is hard to think. These
pagoda-stones, as they are called, arrive in mass, all to
realise money for New Year's debts.</p>

<p>Rocks of various kinds are the special product of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Ichang district, where we could supply all the rockeries
of Shanghai with disintegrated conglomerate. Only,
unfortunately, at this season fern-stones are not in
sufficient beauty to play the part of the Irish pig, and
help to pay the rent. But one day an eagle was shown
into the drawing-room in splendid condition, with grand
yellow beak, and beautiful brown eyes, and neck of
blended tints of brown and bronze. The poor creature's
feet were tightly tied together; but even as it was, we
were careful about admiring its beauties too closely.
Eight hundred cash was all that was even asked by its
captor, who eventually is said to have parted with the
beautiful bird for five hundred cash, or one shilling.</p>

<p>A curious little animal with beautiful long-nailed feet
and tiny tail, and a fur so exquisitely thick and soft
and feathery one quite longed for a collar of it, had not
such luck as the eagle, and died before arriving here;
but of these various luxuries&mdash;for none of these can
quite be reckoned among the necessaries of life&mdash;it is a
little difficult to choose on which to spend one's spare
cash. The fur-shops close before the New Year, which
is the more to be regretted as they offer the most
fascinating footstool covers&mdash;intended for the seats of
roomy Chinese chairs&mdash;made out of two heads of what
are called seven-months' tigers, a thick fur of drab
colour with an admixture of rich brown.</p>

<p>Oranges are what colour the scene,&mdash;mandarin
oranges, of delicious flavour and thinnest possible skin;
and other oranges, slightly indented at either end, and of
a flavour peculiar to the district, and highly appreciated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
But an attempt to examine the orange-market soon
roused a row, when mud and brickbats flew through
the air, so well hurled by some of the Hunan boatmen
as to raise a lump like an egg on the skull of one of
the party before we fairly got away, with our hats
knocked over our eyes, and generally somewhat soiled.
This stoning experience becomes a little monotonous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
I have had hot things thrown at me in Hankow, hot
things and stones in Itu, bricks and earth in Ichang,
and since then so many things in so many less well-known
places. There is a certain amount of excitement
attached to it at first; but the most passionate lover
of excitement could buy it more pleasurably otherwise.
The people you look at always run away, if you look
firmly enough; but then those from behind come on,
and the men on the outskirts of the throng take the
opportunity to throw things under cover of the others.
After all, the shrieking and shouting they keep up
is about the worst part of the proceeding, making one
feel like a mad dog. And to walk through the narrow
streets of a Chinese town in that character is not the
pleasantest possible experience. We enjoyed it to
perfection at Itu, where the people consider they have
conquered the English; for a missionary, having taken
a house there, was not only persuaded by the British
Consul into giving up the house, the owner of which
had as usual in such cases been thrown into prison,
but had even to pay something himself, instead of having
compensation given to him.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the uproarious chorus of "Slay
the foreigner!" the tune to which we habitually walked
about in remote parts of Hupeh Province, the shops
of Itu looked rather inviting. There were beautiful
sheep-skins in great profusion; and even in passing I
was struck by the delicate beauty of some of the fox-skins.
Women's embroidered petticoats were also
hanging up for sale; but this was probably a bad New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Year's sign. In one of the temples at Itu report says
there is an inscription in European characters; but the
hooting crowd did not predispose us to research, the
less so as over all down fell the silent snow, in the
midst of which stalked the most formidable beggar
I have ever yet seen, stripped to the waist, covered
with skin disease, his face plastered with mud of a
livid green hue, his hair wild, and his eyes fierce and
shining.</p>

<p>How comfortable the familiar house-boat looks,
after one of these raids upon the shore, with luncheon
on the table, and the armchairs all equally inviting!
But we were stoned at Ichang with no pleasant house-boat
to make tracks to; and, what is worse, one of the
party wounded, which was a bad precedent, to say the
least of it. And we were met by a French gentleman,
who said, "I was stoned for a whole quarter of an hour
yesterday." It seemed to him, as it did to us, that
these little breaches of the peace, acquiesced in, might
easily lead to serious consequences. The cry of "Slay
the foreigner!" was a novelty that year. It has
become very common since then.</p>

<p>But even without stoning, what a business it is shopping
in a Chinese city! If you go to a shop, and begin
looking at things and asking prices as you might in
Europe, all the rabble of the street pours in after
you. You cannot make yourself heard, you cannot
breathe, you cannot see for the crowd, till the poor
shopkeeper by his imploring gestures at last succeeds
in making you go away before his shop is sacked, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
at least half the things in it broken. The proper way
is to send to the shop. Then a young shopman comes,
very chirpy and self-satisfied, with a quantity of goods,
but very likely nothing that you quite fancy. Then
he asks you to tell him what you want exactly. Do
you want brocade, or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;Here follow names of
silks you never heard of, and never consciously saw.
Do you want to make yourself a skirt or a jacket?
What!&mdash;neither! And do you not want a whole piece
of the silk either? He packs up his goods and goes
off. Then you decide to do the next most right thing&mdash;are
carried to his shop in a sedan-chair, plumped down
at the door of it, and glide into it and through into
the sitting-room behind with wonderful celerity. The
troubled shopkeeper bars one or two gates behind
you, and the curious crowd is shut out. You sit down
in peace, among round wooden columns, upon one of
the straight-backed chairs beside a little black table.
All is tranquil. Tea is brought. A pipe is offered.
No one is in a hurry to serve you. And when you
begin to explain what you want, they treat you like a
silly sort of crazy creature that must be humoured,
and somehow induced to go away. If, however, you
have the good sense to begin by making one or two
somewhat important purchases, everything and everybody
in the shop will be at your service. The Chinese
like buyers. But they object altogether to pricing after
the American fashion.</p>

<p>There is not much more to be bought in Chungking
than in Ichang; but there are bed-spreads of deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
indigo-blue cotton, with an elaborate pattern traced
out on them in a kind of plaster before they are dyed,

there are felt rugs, which have been treated in the same

Chungking we never can decide whether these rugs
look handsome or the reverse. But in the frontier

There are embroideries, of course, to be bought&mdash;there

<p>But China New Year is the great time in every
Chinese city, and this account of China New Year in
Wuchang, the capital of Hupeh Province, is so much
the best I have ever heard, that I must borrow it
from the <i>North China Daily News</i> of February 20th,
1891:</p>

<p>"It requires a good conscience to get any sleep on
Old Year Night in a Chinese city; the whole population
watches the Old Year out. Ask them what they do
all the time, they will say they enjoy themselves; again
ask them how, they will tell you that they sit and chat
all night long. No doubt the opium-pipe and game
of chance help away the time. Certainly, firing crackers
seems to be a large part of the watch-night service.
From dark to dawn and everywhere they bang, bang,
bang on the startled air of night, being intended as
a sort of greeting to the New Year. All the first half
of the night hurry and scurry fill the streets; the city
gates are left open, so that belated creditors may not
be hampered in the collection of their debts. Then
towards midnight the last door is shut, and the last
lucky inscription pasted up. This is a very important
phase of the New Year. Every house in the empire
that can afford it buys antithetical inscriptions for the
two lintels of the door, and for the various other places
of prominence on the walls. The vocabulary of polite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
ornament is ransacked, and the five happinesses, the
points of the compass, rains, snows, winds, sunshine,
country and home, wealth and longevity, are woven
into the garlands of elegant phrases in every possible
combination.
On the doors
themselves
are pasted
new pictures
of the 'Door-Gods',
who
once in the
fabled past
delivered their
monarch from
the nightly
visits of wandering
bogeys,
and whose
pictures have
been found
ever since
sufficient for a similar purpose throughout the empire.
Across the windows are pasted strips of paper&mdash;'Chieh,
the Supreme Duke, is here; bad spirits,
get you gone,' for Chieh in his day, some two
thousand years ago, gained great power over spirits,
and to-day, though they have wit enough to read characters,
they have not wit to know that they are being
taken in, and therefore sneak away abashed when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
find their old controller is within. Over the door-front
is fixed a little mirror, so that any foul fiend who wants
to enter, seeing his own ugly face reflected, will think
another is there before him, and will fear the consequences
of poaching. The 'door of wealth' is then
closed, and the transactions of the year are ended.
The door will in due time be opened once more with
great ceremony, and with proper precautions to ensure
that wealth shall flow in.</p>

<p>"As the night passes on, the guests refresh themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
with the food cooked in preparation; for cooking
must not go on during the first day or so of the year.
A banquet is prepared, and with the first glimmer of the
dawn the head of the household goes out beneath the
sky, and, spreading a carpet and offering viands, bows
down with head to the ground towards the direction
of the spirit of happiness. This spirit is changeable;
he alters his direction every year, and the high
authorities of Peking kindly act as his mouthpiece,
giving notice beforehand to the people in which direction
to bow. This year the dawn of the year saw many a
pigtailed head bowed to the south-west; then followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the worship of ancestors by the whole household; while
crackers and incense completed the welcome. At the
same time the high officials, from the Viceroy downwards,
assemble within the red and yellow walls of
the Emperor's Temple. Great heaps of reeds are
stacked through the neglected courts, which have been
hastily weeded, and as the mandarins approach the
whole scene is made ruddy with huge bonfires. The
great chair of State&mdash;somewhat rickety and of simple
local manufacture&mdash;acts as deputy for the Emperor, all
the officials <i>k`otow</i> in unison, and then for a moment
squat in the peculiar fashion observed in the actual
presence of their sovereign. The temples of Confucius
and the god of war are also visited for similar brief
acts of reverence.</p>

<p>"By this time the day has well dawned, and shortly
the round of calls begins. Everybody dons his best
attire; and the number of buttons of gold on the top
of juvenile or rarely respectable heads is marvellous.
Most careful must everybody be to utter no word of
ill-omen; tiger, death, devil, etc., etc., are all tabooed.
For once in the year the foreigner may go on the
streets with a fair prospect of not being greeted by
the ordinary affectionate terms of abuse; for should any
unfortunate youngster in his wonder call out 'foreign
devil,' summary chastisement is sure to teach him
that the luck of the family is not to be sacrificed
even for the pleasure of baiting an outside stranger.
The streets are filled with all the world paying calls;
the world's wife does not venture out these first few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
days. And the work-worn city keeps its sabbaths
for the whole year all in a fortnight."</p>

<p>Like our Easter, the Chinese New Year varies; but
it generally comes some time in February.</p>

<p>In a small Chinese town, where there was no
buying to be done, one evening we had the gentleman
in charge of the telegraph station to tea. He brought
his operator with him, a most determined young man
of fourteen, who to everything said, "Yes!" Between
them they send two messages a day, morning and
evening, "Yes" and "All right," and that is all they
have to do. "And conceive," said the superior, "that I
spent £12 learning English, and therewith bought five
thousand words, and then am set down in a place like
this, where there is not even anything to eat."</p>

<p>On many of the farmsteads round about Ichang
may be seen a large hieroglyph painted in white, the
character "Fang," with "Shang" on the top of it, in
a circle. It is always very conspicuously placed, and
signifies, "This household pays its yearly tribute to
the robbers, and must not be molested." The village
of Kolopei, just below the Tiger's Teeth Gorge, is
said to consist wholly of the class of whom it may be
said&mdash;as was said to me once of the inhabitants of a
network of common lodging-houses not far off Spitalfields,
wondering at seeing them dancing and making
merry at two o'clock in the afternoon&mdash;"What do
the people here do? Why, they none of them <i>works</i>
for their living."</p>

<p>A day or two after a great fire at Ichang a strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
sight was to be seen. A man, who had been accused of
helping to steal away some poor woman's child during
the confusion, with a white calico placard pasted on to
his coat behind attesting his innocence, his pigtail
hanging unplaited, and wearing a crown of coarse paper
cash, with long streamers of paper cash hanging from it,
was going round from shrine to shrine, at each protesting
his innocence. A man went before him with a gong,
shouting out the whole story. It is to be hoped he was
not one of the eight beheaded next day. What would
be thought of eight executions in one day in Stamford
or Teignmouth? But not so long ago England was
equally bloodthirsty. We must remember that.</p>

<p>Another year we saw a similar sight, only much more
picturesque. As we were going up-river, we met a boat
coming down, and in the bow of it there was a man
kneeling quite upright, with hands held up as if
imploring. In the great beauty of a still reach in the
Gorges it was a very moving spectacle; but it was only
a rough-and-ready way of punishing a man accused of
having tried to steal from his fellows.</p>

<p>I see I have said nothing of medicines. You can
buy rhubarb in bulk quite fresh in Szechuan. It grows
chiefly on the Tibetan border. Even under the Sung
Dynasty the Chinese had three hundred and sixty-five
kinds of drugs and one hundred and thirteen kinds
of formulæ. But they use rough decoctions, and make
tisanes from their drugs; they never make extracts, nor
use minute and accurate weights to dole them out.</p>

<p>The ancient Chinese used metal models to exhibit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
man's inner structure; and everything that is most rare
and dear they think must be useful for a medicine,&mdash;snakes,
scorpions, the velvet off a deer's horns, a
dead caterpillar with grass growing out of its head,
tigers' bones, beautiful orchids, of which last whole
boatloads float down from Chungking to Ichang. A
Chinaman loves medicine; nothing pleases him better
than to take it; and the European is always being
asked for remedies, not so much because he believes
foreign remedies to be good, but because he has found
out to his delight and amazement that they are to be had
for nothing. One doctor, delighted at the great reputation
he thought he was acquiring amongst Chinese, was
disgusted to find that as soon as he ceased giving away
bottles with his medicines patients ceased to apply for
them. But the benefits of quinine are so striking, that
a Chinaman is ready to ask for this, even when you
put it into his mouth for him. They suffer very much
from fever, poor people! and when one thinks how
many years they have stood the violent changes of
their climate without ever a respite, and how much we
ourselves lose our energy when exposed to them, one
begins to feel more tolerance for a Chinaman's apparent
inertia. Besides, what has he to gain by exerting
himself? If he become rich, is not the life of a rich
Chinaman so dull that only opium makes it possible
to endure it? Once let Chinamen get a taste of the
enjoyment of life, and they will be a different people.
Now they suffer from fever as we do; they dislike bad
smells, too, it seems&mdash;for no nation more delights in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
sweet-smelling flowers; they get depressed, and hipped
as we do; and they have no light literature, no sports,
very little of a newspaper press, no picture-galleries,
no concerts, no bands, no intercourse with women,
except of the baser sort. No wonder they look dull.
And how they love to be amused!

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<i>SOLDIERS.</i></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Tiger Soldiers.&mdash;Woosung Drill.&mdash;General's Gallantry.&mdash;Japanese
War.&mdash;Admiral Ting.&mdash;Dominoes
with a Sentry.&mdash;Viceroy's Review.
</p>
</div>

<p>At Ichang, a thousand miles up the river Yangtse,
there is a regiment of soldiers dressed as tigers;
but I never could persuade any of the foreign officials
to escort me to see them man&oelig;uvre, the European
opinion being that not even the presence of an inspecting
general would awe the Tiger soldiers sufficiently
to make it safe to take a foreign lady to see them.
I was told that the Tigers were not really soldiers at
all, but that some officer drew pay for them as if they
existed; and then when the General came to inspect,
all the beggars and riff-raff of the city put on the Tiger
uniform over their rags, and turned out in so disorderly
a condition that even their officers were afraid of them.
And so it turned out that, except from a passing steamer,
I never saw Chinese soldiers drill till I did so at
Woosung, the new Treaty Port, at the junction of the
Whangpoo, on which Shanghai is situated, with the
great river Yangtse.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday in autumn, and the early morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
air felt keen as we steamed down to Woosung, and
landed at the fort. Eleven gunboats in a row, all
decorated with large flags, the biggest flag in each
boat a different arrangement of black, red, yellow,
and white, had prepared us for its being a gala day,
but hardly for the pretty sight we found upon the
parade-ground, where five hundred men were being
drilled with a hundred banners among them, not to
speak of bannerets, many of the banners being ten
feet square. The men formed in square, in rallying
groups, fired altogether, one after the other, all to
the sound of a bugle, without a single order being
given. Drill sergeants in huge straw hats stood
before them, and inspected them; and the men's
own dress was picturesque enough&mdash;loose jackets with
large characters upon them behind and before placed in
circles like targets, and large loose-flapping leg-guards of
decided colours. To the bugle's note the men folded
their banners round the spears they carried, to the
bugle's note they again flung them loose to the wind,
executing both man&oelig;uvres with a singular adroitness.
There was never a hitch, and the drill appeared
admirable, recalling that to be seen from Birdcage Walk
in a very curious fashion; for it was every now and
again diversified by a primitively savage jump forward
with spears pointed, to the sound of a terror-inspiring
yell, and then a sort of goose-step retreat, after which
the banners that had been tightly wound round the
spears were shaken out again, and the men became
civilised soldiers once more, admirably drilled.

<p class="caption">JUNK.<br />
<i>From a Picture by a Chinese Artist.</i></p>
</div>

<p>After this I saw no more of Chinese soldiers for
some time, only noticed that the one Chinese mandarin
who showed anything approaching to gallantry towards
me was a Chinese general, who, calling upon the Consul
with whom we were staying in all his war-paint, was
kind enough to take off his necklace for me to admire,
when I had broken the ice by praising his embroideries;
drew up his gown for me to admire his boots, which,
like his necklace, were insignia of his official standing;
and finally invited us, whenever we could succeed in
effecting a landing there, to spend a long and happy
day at new Kweichow. Unfortunately this city, built
by order, is so situated, with all the worst rocks in the
river just at the foot of it, that hardly any one ever
can land there; and we never have succeeded in so
doing, which I the more regretted as he was kindly
careful to inform me that, though his own wife was
dead, his daughter-in-law would do the honours to me.
I flattered myself at the time that I had made quite
an impression upon the General, who was over six
feet one, and fully broad in proportion, and who presented
a most gorgeous appearance in long brocade
gown embroidered for about a foot round the bottom
with waves of the sea and other Chinese devices. He
wore also a long satin coat with embroidered breast-plate,
and a similar square of embroidery on the back,
with the horseshoe cuffs, forced upon the Chinese by
the Manchus when the present dynasty came to the
throne, falling over his hands. High official boots,
an amber necklace of very large beads reaching to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
his waist, and aureole-shaped official cap with large red
tassel, completed his costume. And when he first
advanced into the room, and found me seated there
with the British Consul, on whom he was paying a
visit of ceremony, the huge creature turned back,
growing crimson and giggling like a schoolgirl, as he
said to one of his attendants (a numerous retinue of
pipe-bearers and the like followed him), "Here is one
of these foreign women. Whatever am I to do? I
never was in a room with one before, and have no
notion how to behave." Yet such is army training all
the world over, that in five minutes the General was
doing the polite in the most finished style.</p>

<p>There must be something in being a soldier&mdash;even
in being a Chinese soldier. When we travelled with
some thirty or so coolies and attendants, it was of
course necessary for me to decide upon one man whose
duty it was, whenever I got out of my sedan-chair, to
follow me with the camera, help me to set it up, and
generally attend upon me. Twice I picked out my man,
without knowing anything of his antecedents, and in
each case found I had selected the one ex-soldier of the
company. It was idle for our man-servant to say they
were probably bad characters, for a man did not go
away from home and become a soldier for nothing.
They were so handy and obliging, that, though both,
alas! have come to grief since then, I have still a soft
corner of my heart for my two Lao Liu's; for curiously
enough both rejoiced in the same name, and mightily
jealous of each other they were when they ultimately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
met. When it is considered that their duties varied
from carrying my little dog, the untiring companion
of all our wild travel, to carrying me myself pick-a-back
across a mountain torrent, and included choosing
the picturesque view-points for photographs (at least
they both thought themselves mighty fine judges on
this point), as well as defending me from infuriate
peasantry when they rushed at me with mattocks, and
regularly carrying me in a sedan when that was the
mode of progression, together with collecting and caring
for all my little odds and ends of wraps, boots, and the
like, it may be seen what a very handy creature a
Chinese soldier is, when he&mdash;shall we say is after a soft
billet, or wants to oblige a lady?</p>

<p>Of course, we had unpleasant experiences with
soldiers sometimes. On the <span class="smcap">S.S.</span> <i>Kuling</i> they stole every
portable bit of brass off the steamer whilst making a
little voyage in her. On the <span class="smcap">S.S.</span> <i>Yling</i> they managed to
eat up or carry off all the food that had been intended
to last for months, whilst their officers were being
entertained by my husband at a dinner party.</p>

<p>Then came the Japanese War, and all the river
between Ichang and Hankow became gay with most
picturesque junks laden with Chinese soldiers going to
the war. Their flags flew upon the breeze; they themselves,
in their motley and decorative uniforms, sat in
groups mounted up on top of the junks. Occasionally
the old-world, almost antediluvian music of their long,
somewhat mournful trumpets sounded across the water.
"Nous allons à la boucherie, à la boucherie, à la
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
boucherie," sang
the French recruits
in their
train-loads hurrying
to fight the
Germans. These
Chinese levies
might well have
sung the same.
But they sat impassive
and
yellow-faced beneath
their high
black turbans,
apparently in nowise
excited or
discontented with
their lot. How
mercifully the
future hides from
us what may be in store for us on the morrow! And
how terrible would it be, could some</p>

<p>These Hunan soldiers evidently looked upon themselves
as "braves," sure of their rice; good, honest
fellows they looked most of them, well grown and
well fed. But to us they appeared as victims upon
the altar of Chinese corruption and ineptitude. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
is it our hearts harden in China? There are so
many victims in the world one contemplates with
more of sorrow than these Chinese soldiers as they
floated down the great river in their red and orange,
with the black kerchiefs of Hunan binding their
yellow brows. To the butchery! To the butchery!
Float on, Chinese soldiers, all unconscious of your
doom, and convinced beyond the power of argument
and canon that there is no race like the Chinese
race, and that all other nations are your subjects
born&mdash;rebellious, perhaps, but to be subject to the
end! It is a somewhat similar conviction which
carries the Anglo-Saxon race forward&mdash;indeed, each
nation in turn, till it meets its destiny in the God-appointed
hour.</p>

<p>The story of the Japanese War has been written
for the Chinese by Dr. Allen, and read with avidity
by them. For the English public it has not been
written. Contradictory telegrams arrived till people
began to look in doubt upon any news emanating from
Shanghai. But, indeed, the truth was incredible. It
was impossible to believe that the Empress and Li
Hung-chang between them had brought their nation
to such a pass that no regiment was properly armed.
If they had got the guns, they had not got the cartridges
that fitted them; but generally speaking they had not
got the guns. The men stolidly appreciated the situation;
they made no complaint; but when they could
they ran away, which was about the only thing they
could do under the circumstances. Did not six generals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
bolt before one battle? Or
was that one of the telegrams
that reached us in
the west of China, where we
were even less well informed
than people in England?
People talked of the feats
of Chinese soldiery under
Gordon, forgetting always
that these feats were performed
by Chinese soldiers
properly armed, and against
soldiers who were also
Chinese, and not led by
Gordons, nor properly armed.
It is still a question whether
Chinese will ever stand
against a European army.
They have the greatest contempt
for their own soldiery,
call them by a title of contempt&mdash;Ping
Ting!&mdash;regard
fighting altogether as barbarous,
and long ago were
of the opinion now enunciated to the world by the
Russian Czar.</p>

<p>After the war was over, the poor soldiers were certainly
as badly treated as they could possibly deserve.
Their officers pocketed their pay, and then decamped,
leaving their men in many cases completely destitute,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
out at elbows, and far away from their homes. No
wonder that they misconducted themselves! Comical
enough incidents occurred during the war; as, for
instance, when a company of Cantonese soldiers stopped
for food and rest at a little village. The villagers
willingly disposed of food at good prices; and the
soldiers were about to leave, when a village elder
informed them that the
Japanese were in the
neighbourhood, and he
would advise them to
leave their weapons
and ammunition in the
village; for if the
Japanese saw them
armed, they would
think they had come to
fight, and would kill
them all. This seemed
good advice to the
soldiers; so they requested
that they might
be allowed to leave
their weapons in the
village till some future
day. The villagers
consented, and the
guns and cartridges
were stacked together;
but no sooner had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
soldiers started on their way, than the villagers seized
the guns, and commenced a deadly fire on the now
disarmed braves. Many were killed, and all were
robbed of everything about them, until their costume
was scarcely as extensive as that usually worn by a
Swatow fisherman.</p>

<p>Here is a sad little account of one detachment, taken
from a Chinese paper:</p>

<p>"The first batch of Hunan men who are without
occupation, property, or income is three hundred and
seventeen in number. H. E. ordered them to be taken
by gunboat to their homes. Those who belonged to
Hengyang were to receive $3 (6<i>s.</i>) each as expenses for
their land journey, and those of Changsha $2 (4<i>s.</i>) each.
On the day of debarkation, they were marched from
the city to Shakuan; but on reaching that place their
number had diminished to one hundred and eighty, the
others having fallen out, complaining of sickness and
fatigue, though the distance they had traversed was only
about six miles. These invalids were handed over to
the guardhouses along the road for safe keeping, and
will be deported with the next batch. The crusade is
being continued with great vigour, and no doubt the
ultimate number of deportees will amount to many
thousands."</p>

<p>When a general intended to review the four
battalions of troops that do duty on the Grand Canal,
he found that, instead of numbering sixteen hundred, as
they ought to do, they practically did not exist, and that,
"as was universally the case in the army," the pay of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
the skeleton force that was maintained was three months
in arrear. Their number was simply made up against
the general in command holding a review, and as soon
as he left the old system of corruption was resorted to.</p>

<p>One of the few men who distinguished himself on
the Chinese side in the late war was Admiral Ting;
and as illustrating the career of a Chinese soldier, it may
be as well to relate his history, for this noble admiral
was in reality a Chinese brave. Born of poor parents,
and having had to work hard for a living, he entered
the army as a private at the age of sixteen; but after
a few years was promoted to be an officer. In the war
against the rebels in the Western provinces, he fought
as a captain in Li Hung-chang's cavalry, and after that
was promoted to be colonel of the same regiment.
During the Taiping rebellion, he again distinguished
himself as an officer.</p>

<p>But when China began to form a fleet in 1880, not
having any naval officers, she had to look for some
one amongst the officers of the army to take command
of her squadron of alphabetical gunboats, and Ting was
ordered to fill this post by Imperial Decree. At first,
in all matters of navigation, he had to seek help from
his subordinate officers, some of whom had been brought
up in foreign military and naval schools, and by doing
so lost much of his authority. But by degrees he learnt
to know as much about navigation and seamanship as
any of them; and when in 1884 some one was wanted
to go to England to bring out two new cruisers, it
was again Ting who was selected. Western civilisation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
seems to have made a real impression upon him; and
after returning from Europe, his great wish was always
to form a navy that might be sufficient to defend the
Chinese coast, and with this object in view he adopted
as far as possible European customs. Many Europeans
came in contact with him whilst at Chefoo, and all seem
to have been most favourably impressed by him. When
the Japanese War began, Ting's views often differed from
those of his Government; but he knew that his duty
was to obey, and so with resolution he awaited the
fate that he clearly saw must one day befall him. For
he knew that by the laws of his country his life would
be forfeited by the loss of his ships and Wei-hai-wei.
After the fall of Port Arthur, he had been deprived
of his honours, and ordered to proceed to Peking
and give himself over to the Board of Punishment;
but owing to the remonstrances of all the European
officers of the fleet, this edict had been cancelled, and
the brave old soldier reinstated as admiral in command.
After the fall of Wei-hai-wei, he knew there was nothing
for him but death, and he preferred to perish by his
own hand, and thus save his family from dishonour,
rather than to be decapitated. All his countrymen
approved his action; and so this man, who had risen from
the lowliest position, died, as he had lived, respected.
Kind and fatherly to his soldiers as to his family, he
had been greatly beloved. But in the condition to
which Li Hung-chang and the Empress Tze Hsi had
brought both fleet and army, what other end could
there be for a brave soldier?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>The army was, indeed, divided against itself. At
Kiangyin, on the Yangtse, where there were German
instructors, the main powder magazine on the left bank
of the river blew up; it was never known whether by
accident or design, although it looked like the latter.
Two hundred lives were lost, and there were many
wounded. The foreigners on the right bank were afraid
to cross, as the Anhui soldiers were in a state of
mutiny, holding their general prisoner, and intending
to kill him. They were decided, should the mutiny
spread, to move over to the Hunan men, on whom they
could rely, and who would not assist the Anhui men.
They knew that the general was keeping back his men's
pay; and although the intervention of the Literary
Chancellor had been asked, no reliance was placed on
his power of pacifying the soldiery, his corruption was
known to be so great.</p>

<p>The German officer who had been acting as General
at Woosung close to Shanghai up to the spring of
1898 gave a most amusing, though somewhat disheartening,
account of his handing over his command.
The Chinese did not want to have German officers any
more, so a Chinese General was to take command;
and first he did not arrive, although the men were all
drawn up under arms waiting for him, because he had
suddenly found out it was an unlucky day; so he had
had his boats moored up a creek, and was quietly waiting
there. The German was indignant, and required him
once more to fix his day. A Sunday was appointed, and
the German sent to inform him that all the men would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
again be drawn up, and that when he saw the Chinese
General riding forward he would give order, "Shoulder
arms! Present arms!" then
the Chinese General must
say, "Order arms!" and
then the command would
be given over. "But surely
I am not expected to ride?
I cannot possibly ride," replied
the Chinese General.
The German persisted he
must ride. So on the appointed
day there appeared
the Chinese General huddled
on to a very small
pony, with two men holding
it one on each side, and a
third holding an umbrella
over him, for it was raining
hard. He at once shouted
out his word of command;
but as the previous order
had not been given, it
could not be followed. The
German tried to explain this. "Oh," said the Chinese
General, "I cannot believe it does any one any good to
be kept out in rain like this. Just tell the men they can
go away. This will do for to-day." So the men dispersed,
and the German cavalry officer felt there was the
end of his efforts for many years to uphold discipline.</p>

<i>By Mr. Cecil Hanbury.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, the story is well known of Admiral Lang
going off to a Chinese man-of-war to see if discipline
were well maintained, and finding no sentry outside
the Chinese Admiral's cabin. Going in to protest, he
found the Admiral and another playing dominoes.
"Really, Admiral," he began, "I thought you had
promised me to maintain discipline. How is it, then, I
find no sentry outside your door?" "Oh, well, I am
very sorry," replied the Chinese Admiral. "But I
really was so dull, I just asked him in to play dominoes
with me."</p>

<p>The days of old-time Chinese reviews must be
numbered, and so I will conclude this chapter with
an account of the one great one I have seen. The
Viceroy arrived the day before. Great was the show of
flags, and the whole city was in a white heat of excitement.
We foreigners were all going about, each
guarded by two soldiers in front of us, intelligent-seeming,
very civil men, in beautiful new clothes, their
bright-red waistcoats giving them a very festive appearance.
There were besides numbers of men in orange
coats, who seemed to have some duty as regarded
keeping order; whilst <i>tsaijen</i> (messengers), with pale,
anxious-looking faces, sprang forward in dozens to protect
me, when I went to examine the parade-ground.
All the houses had been removed from it, and a mock
city wall with five gates built across it by means of
dark-blue cotton, with white chalk lines to simulate the
joins of the blocks of stone. All the world (without
his wife) had been out drinking tea at tables there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
and the scene was what Chungking people call <i>reh-lau</i>,
or "really jolly."</p>

<p>The next day we were all to get up at five o'clock,
we understood, and dressed in Chinese clothes; for
places had been arranged for the foreigners to see the
sight, but we were requested if possible not to shock
the populace by our queer foreign dress. The city
was full of strangers, many of them with very flushed
faces&mdash;a great contrast in their <i>insouciance</i> to the stream
of extremely grave, anxious-looking mandarins in chairs
coming back in full dress from waiting upon the great
man. The review was beautifully set upon the stage;
the Viceroy's entrance could hardly be improved upon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">
"Behind him march the halberdiers,</p>
<p>Before him sound the drums!"</p></div></div>

<p>In the band there were men with long trumpets,
such as those before which the walls of Jericho fell
down. They blew, and men advanced through the
gates of the city wall, built up of blue cotton, with white
chalk marks; other men carried boards with titles;
others came following after, and then stopped and stood
in front of them, and so on, and so on; executioners with
conical scarlet caps, boys with long Reeves' pheasant
feathers in their caps, and all the curious insignia so
well known in China, till at last there was a long line
of them on either side all the way from the mock city
wall to the tribune where the Viceroy was to sit,
on one side of which was the Chinese bandstand,
beside it again the box very politely set apart for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
foreigners, all hung with green reed-blinds to shield us
from the people's stare.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0304" id="i_0304"></a>
<img src="images/i_0304.jpg" width="365" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SOLDIERS.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Bishop.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Some of us really had been there since 5 a.m.; but
not till about 9.30 did the trumpets sound. Then the
great green Viceroy's chair with its multitude of bearers
appeared through the city gates, forty banner-men all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
drooped their beautiful silken banners in the wet before
him, whilst the army as one man went on its knees.
The Viceroy entered the tribune, and the review began.
But that entry could not have been better, if so well
done, at Drury Lane. And the rest, too, was excellently
staged. There was the usual extraordinary mixture of
foreign and native drill,&mdash;fours about, hollow squares
with the cavalry inside, the "thin red lines o' 'eroes,"
and volley-firing, with, in between, wonderful advances
of the banner-men, shaking the long poles, round which
their banners were rolled, and shouting defiance at
the foe. Then in and out and round about darted the
Tigers, in ochre-yellow cotton made almost in the foreign
fashion, coatees cut short, and trousers not baggy, and
tucked in at the boot, as it seemed, at first glance.
Then they turned round, and revealed the tiger stripings
on their backs and on their ochre-yellow hoods. They
came on with long catlike strides, then leapt, then
hid behind shields painted to represent the tiger's open
jaws, then strode stealthily again, and went through
many cotillion figures, their round painted shields sometimes
forming a tent for all the tigers, sometimes a
series of ladders. Then for a very long time men
singly or in twos danced before the Viceroy, showing
their skill with two-pronged forks made to catch the
enemies' clothes, and rakes, and what in the end looked
like a highly painted japanned table-top. Then
suddenly, from opposite corners of the parade-ground,
darted wild horsemen, each in fantastic attire and on
a dashing pony, representing an attacking force of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
savages; and the army fired on every side at once.
Then the artillery appeared with the most marvellous
of cannon, slight and somewhat dragon-shaped, and
muzzle-loading of course, requiring to be laboriously
wheeled round after each volley, and resting on some
strange, outlandish supports, that had puzzled us
foreigners much whilst carried round upon the shoulders
of what now proved to be the artillery.</p>

<p>We all felt somewhat mockingly inclined, we
Americans, English, and Japanese, looking on from
behind the blinds we so often pushed aside to see
better. But the worst of it all was, it was all well
done; the men appeared well drilled; and though, as
the rain fell more and more, the Tigers no longer
bounded as at first, and even their stride lost somewhat
of its stealth in the general slipperiness, yet the
heartrending thought to all of us was, the thing was
meant to be real. As a spectacle it was so successful!
But those poor men down there would march in that
style against modern weapons of precision, used in
accordance with modern tactics, and of course had
<i>run away</i>! "Poor old China! Poor old China!" rose
like a chorus from the pitiful ones. And we wondered,
Did the Viceroy realise what he was looking on at?
Did his cheeks burn, as our own did? Or did he
really know no better, and think it a fine sight, as
it was?</p>

<p>The whole wound up with a display on the part
of the archers. Silken-clad young men with official
red silk-tasselled caps, and the corners of their long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
gowns tucked up, followed each by a soldier-servant
holding above the heads of the crowd a quiver full of
arrows, made their way up to the Viceregal tribune,
and shot at a target white and long-shaped with three
red bulls'-eyes one above the other. Each time they
did so a big, very big drum was beaten, and a man
sprang forward, and picked up the arrow, holding it
very ostentatiously at arm's-length. The theatrical
effect again was very good; but as far as we could any
of us see not one hit any of the bulls'-eyes, and through
opera-glasses the paper surface appeared intact, when
the Viceroy got into his chair and went off in much
the same state as he had come; only every one was
wet through now, and the poor little boys with the
Reeves' feathers looked particularly deplorable. On a
rough computation, on this occasion at Chungking five
hundred soldiers turned out, three hundred of whom,
including forty banner-men, were versed in foreign drill
and wore scarlet waistcoats. The others were either
tigers or orange-clad.</p>

<p>As to the Viceroy, he must have been used to it;
for was he not going round the province from Fu city
to Fu city reviewing troops? and did it not always rain?
He therefore must be accustomed to the archers' consequent
failures. But we wondered somewhat sorrowfully
whether we had had the great privilege of assisting
at one of the last Viceregal reviews of the kind, one
of the last survivals of antediluvian periods. All nations
have passed through similar stages, as the Scottish
sword-dances, Highland flings, and English beefeaters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
remind us. Or could it be that China is going to
persist in living still longer in the Middle Ages? In
the one case&mdash;for we Europeans are nothing, if we are
not practical&mdash;let us at once buy up one of the painted
shields, and Tiger uniforms, and too often brandished
banners with their tribes of attended bannerets. In
the other, let us stand back, and look aside, lest our
hearts should be too much torn by pity when the
great catastrophe comes, and China meets a foe who
follows his thrusts home, and is determined to reap the
full fruit of his victories.

<p>Far more formidable than the soldiery are the
literati of China. Soldiering is despised in
China; learning is esteemed. The literati also are far
more numerous; they arrive in great armies, nominally
ten thousand strong or more, and each young man of
any standing has his pipe-bearer and three or more
servants, possibly in the case of military students a
horse or two and attendant grooms as well. In the
summer of 1897 at Chengtu there were fourteen thousand
candidates, who had already passed the first of the
five examinations necessary before entering the highest
body in China, the Hanlin College. They were all
what is commonly Englished into B.A.'s; that is, Shiu
Tsai, or Budding Talent. <i>And there were ninety-six
degrees to be conferred!</i> Picture the disappointment
in a land where for twelve centuries no official post
of any kind has been conferred without preliminary
examination. Men go up year after year, year after
year, in many cases collecting contributions from friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
and patrons towards travelling expenses. Sometimes
these contributions are given under promise that, if the
needy student do not pass this year, he will not try
again. But this is a promise made to be broken. And
I believe it is really true, if a man go on competing
for his B.A. and failing, at the age of eighty he is
considered to have passed.</p>

<p>In 1891 the Governor of Yunnan said that it was
also permissible under certain circumstances to bring to
the notice of the Throne cases of scholars well advanced
in years who have failed to pass their examinations for
the degree of <i>chüjen</i>, and begged to recommend for
favourable consideration the case of Lien Hsiang-yang,
a Bachelor of over eighty years of age, who had failed
to pass at the last examination. He had obtained his
degree of Bachelor only nine years before, and in the
eyes of the memorialist his praiseworthy endeavours
to scale the heights of Parnassus ought to meet with
some recognition.</p>

<p class="caption">TEMPLE OF GOD OF LITERATURE.<br />
<i>By Rev. E. J. Piper.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is a curious method, that of a Chinese examination.
The Literary Chancellor of the province travels round
from city to city. Suddenly there is an influx of new
faces, and the streets are full of strangers looking about
them. Missionaries always say, "The students are
swaggering about." When the Consul does not send
out a request for Europeans to keep within-doors
or to be careful, I straightway order my sedan-chair,
and pretend I want to buy something near the examination-hall.
Any one, who knows the monotony of
always blue gowns and a slouch, would understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
that the idea of
"some one swaggering"
is irresistible.
But so
far I have never
succeeded in
seeing even one
military student
swagger. I know
the mandarin
swagger, and the
Tientsin swagger,
which is the most
audacious of all,
and would make
every one in Bond
Street turn round to look; and I know the young
merchant swagger, which is amusing, and not very
unlike a very young London clubman's swagger, when
he does swagger. I am afraid it a little went out when
high collars came in. But the students I have seen
have mostly been pale, very anxious-looking young
men, who drop in at our luncheon-time, and look with
great interest at our foreign things, sitting on for ever,
when they find we have actually specimens of the
books of that most useful Society for the Diffusion
of Christian and General Knowledge. Then they
turn them over and are happy, till they suddenly wake
up sadly to the fact we have no more. "And I
wanted to take back copies to all my friends in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
town of &mdash;&mdash;," said one student that I know. But
then he did not pass. He is a reformer, a dreamer,
as the Secretaries of Legation at Peking dub all of
the party of progress in China; for that city seems to
deaden the very souls of the Diplomatic Corps, walled
up inside it, away from all their own nationals, and full
of their parties and theatricals and petty jealousies,
unaware apparently that there is a great Chinese nation
throbbing across some two thousand miles of country
south and west.</p>

<p>Then there are the brilliant students, who pass every
time, and are going up for the Hanlin College. They
are very much afraid of turning their attention away
from the classics for a moment to look even at histories
of the Japanese War or of the nineteenth century.
They know all about the Röntgen rays, but they dare
not be interested. They have got to pass, and to
get means to do so they must teach other young
men to pass preliminary examinations; and they have
brought the latter up with them from some small country
town, and are responsible for them. More than the
weight of empire seems resting upon their young
shoulders; but the fact that they come to see us, and
come again, shows that they are interested in foreign
affairs. To one I undertook to teach English in a
six weeks' holiday last Chinese New Year season. He
learnt the alphabet in two days; then he learnt easy
words; but why <i>c&nbsp;a&nbsp;t</i> should spell <i>cat</i>, because <i>b&nbsp;a&nbsp;t</i>
spelt <i>bat</i>, he could not imagine. The very idea of an
alphabet is so strange to a Chinaman. He thinks what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
you want him to do is to learn it by heart, and he
conscientiously learns it. Then when you dodge him
he is mortified. As to spelling, I know no way to make
him understand it, until he has learnt how to spell;
till then it is a mystery to him. He was a most brilliant
young scholar, who had already passed his second
examination with great <i>éclat</i>, whom I essayed to teach,
and every now and then I seemed to see glimmerings
of understanding, but then again all became dark, as I
tried desperately to teach him to read, so that he might
go on teaching himself in his distant country town.</p>

<p>But when the examinations are really on, no more
students, swaggering or not swaggering, are seen
about the streets. They are all shut up for twenty-four
hours, and they come out in batches, according as to
when they have done their essays, at the three watches
of the night, tired out and hungry. They go up for
this preliminary according to their district; then those
who are most successful of the different districts are
shut up to compete against one another. At each
examination a poem must be written in addition to two
essays. Not uncommonly students die at these examinations.
But the marvel to me is that the Literary
Chancellor survives, for he <i>keeps on at it</i> pretty well
all the time. Sometimes he is accused of being very
much influenced by money bribes as to those he
passes; sometimes he is reputed honest.</p>

<p>When the second of two brothers passed in the same
year his examination as <i>chüjen</i> (or M.A.), he was carried

favourite subject of embroidery is the triumphal return
of the successful student, with a silk official umbrella
borne over his head, himself mounted on a spotted
pony, and all the village in its best clothes come out
to do him honour.</p>

<p>There are very strict rules as to who may compete
at examinations. Barbers are not allowed to go up;
and a barber's son having passed brilliantly in Hupeh
province a few years ago, his degree was taken from
him because of his father's business. On this all the
barbers of the principal cities of Hupeh struck work&mdash;a
terrible position, for no Chinaman can endure life
without frequent resort to a barber to shave afresh the
front part of his head, and comb and plait his long
queue.</p>

<p>But not only must your father not be of low
occupation, but you must most emphatically be native
born.</p>

<p>The <i>Peking Gazette</i> of February 20th, 1891, records
that "the number of provincial graduates being limited,
and the right to compete for the degree of <i>chüjen</i> being
strictly confined in each province to those, who have
attained the standing of natives thereof either through
birth or domicile, the intrusion of outsiders is jealously
resented, and much contention frequently takes place as
to the origin of a successful candidate. The Censorate
recently received a petition numerously signed by
graduates from Kweichow, in which they represented
that a number of persons had attained degrees in their
province under circumstances which urgently called for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
an investigation. The Governor, from whom a report
was called for on the subject, admits that the graduates
to whom exception had been taken are not natives
of the province, although they are, he adds, either
domiciled there, or the descendants of officials who have
not been able to return to their native places. The
province, he explains, was originally the home of the
aborigines, and strictly speaking contains no native
population of Chinese. The first provincial examination
was held in the year 1537, but even then the number of
Chinese settlers was very small. During the beneficent
rule of the present dynasty influential families have
flocked in from other provinces, and literature has
received a marked impetus; but the formality of becoming
domiciled subjects has very rarely been attended
to. Indeed, had a hard-and-fast rule been adopted
in the matter, there is good reason for believing that
Kweichow would never have emerged from its state of
barbarism. The last quarter of a century has witnessed
repeated disturbances in the province, which interfered
seriously with the regular conduct of the examinations.
A great change has recently taken place for the better;
but still there are numerous cases where people have
become domiciled and have completed the necessary
term of residence without having made a formal report
of the circumstances to the authorities. The memorialist
concludes by suggesting that five of the accused graduates
should be debarred from competing next time at
the higher examinations, and that the law respecting
property qualification and a term of residence extending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
over twenty years should be strictly enforced for the
future."</p>

<p>Again, on April 10th, 1891, "the Governor of
Fengt`ien brings forward a grievance on the part of
the farmers attached to the Collectorate of Rent Department,
a branch of the Imperial household at Moukden.
These farmers have hitherto been debarred from competing
at the examinations on what would seem to be
insufficient grounds, and have asked that their status
be thoroughly gone into and definitely established. It
appears there are four classes of employés attached to
the Collectorate of Rent; namely, the foremen of agricultural
labourers, the agricultural labourers themselves,
labourers attached to the households of the foremen
in a menial capacity, and foundlings brought up in
what presumably is an orphanage. The two classes
first enumerated are borne on the regular banner-roll
by themselves. In a memorial presented to the
Throne in 1862 it was requested that permission be
given to the foremen to compete and that menials
and foundlings be debarred. Nothing was said about
the agricultural labourers, and the authorities did not in
consequence feel justified in allowing them to enter.
These latter have, however, produced regular stamped
title-deeds showing that they are the <i>bona-fide</i> holders
of banner-land. Strictly speaking, such title-deeds
ought never to have been issued to them; but as they
bear date as far back as 1791, and as it has been
proved that they are actually borne on the same roll
as the foremen, it would seem as if there were no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
distinction between them and the ordinary bannermen.
Memorialist would point out that in 1825 the same
question was raised with regard to the labourers tilling
ecclesiastical lands under the Moukden Board of
Revenue, and that it was then decided that all such, who
were borne on the regular banner-roll, and whose record
was without stain, should be allowed to compete. They
accordingly would request that the matter be referred
to the Board of Rites for consideration, and they trust
the Board will see its way to remove the present
restriction.&mdash;<i>Let the Board of Rites consider and
report.</i>"</p>

<p>Yet in spite of all these restrictions "while the
students were rushing into the Wuchang examination-hall
for a recent competition an errand-boy nine years
old was trampled to death and horribly mutilated. The
crowd was so dense that it was impossible to extricate
the body until the space was cleared."</p>

<p>The literati are generally charged with being the
most reactionary body in China. Yet we find "Chang-chih-tung
and the Provincial Examiner of Hupeh asking
for permission to allow the latter to proceed by steamer
to conduct the examinations at Chingchow and Ichang.
They describe very graphically the extreme inconvenience
and discomfort of the native modes of conveyance,
the long delays beating up against the stream,
and the risk their papers and other belongings run of
being lost or damaged by water. The Examiner
mentions that on former trips, when the roads have
been flooded, several of his coolies have been drowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
by mistaking the paths, and all the inhabitants having
fled before the water no accommodation was to be had
for man or beast. To proceed by steamer would in
every way be a saving, no risk would be run, the journey
would be accomplished in two or three days, and the
students be saved the vexatious delays they have had
to undergo in former years while awaiting the arrival
of the Examiner, who has met with delays and difficulties
on the road.&mdash;<i>Granted.</i>"</p>

<p class="caption">OUTSIDE CONFUCIUS' GRAVE.</p>
</div>

<p>Alas! when all is over, when men have got the right to
compete and have competed successfully&mdash;are, for instance,
among the ninety-six chosen out of fourteen thousand&mdash;what
then? According to the <i>Peking Gazette</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
September 22nd, "ten years ago the Governor of Honan
asked that no expectant officials should be sent to the
province for a period of two years, in order to relieve the
stagnation which prevailed in the lower ranks of the Civil
Service. The present Governor states that immediately
after the expiration of the above period crowds of
expectant officers again began to pour into the province,
the evil having been greatly intensified by the renewal
of the system of purchasing office. At the present
moment there are 60 expectant candidates for the posts
of Taotai, Prefect, and Senior Magistrate; over 70 for
those of Sub-Prefect and Assistant Sub-Prefect; more
than 300 aspiring to be Department and District Magistrates;
and 1,020 waiting for minor appointments in
the Civil Service. The stream of arrivals continues
month after month, and utter congestion is the natural
result. Considerable retrenchment is being carried out
in the provincial administration, and the great majority
of these expectants have little prospect of temporary
and much less of permanent employment. A process
of weeding out the less meritorious could not fail to
be attended with invidious consequences, and all the
memorialist can suggest is that the measure introduced
by his predecessor should be reinforced for a further
term of two years. This will, he hopes, work off to
some extent the present redundant supply of official
aspirants, and, being applicable only to Honan, will
not materially interfere with the funds raised for coast-defence
purposes from the sale of the office.&mdash;<i>Referred
to the consideration of the Board of Civil Office.</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst, according to a Chinese newspaper in 1891,
"there were over two thousand expectant military officials
in Nanking alone, all offices were filled, and these
expectants have scarcely any hope of obtaining one.
A monthly examination in rifle-shooting, with rewards
for skilful marksmen, is the only means to afford them
a precarious livelihood. On the arrival of the new
Viceroy Liu, the <i>yamen</i> was daily crowded by those,
who had formerly fought against the Taipings, petitioning
for some office or commission."</p>

<p>About fourteen thousand Bachelors are added to the
list every year. There are probably close on seven
hundred thousand Chinese graduates now living. It is
the expectants of office, who are one of China's greatest
dangers, men embittered by feeling that they have
themselves been unjustly passed over, who have never
been given opportunity to show what they could do,
and who are incapable of doing what alone lies before
them; although in the west of China we have come
across one man who had taken a high degree keeping
a wayside inn in a very lonely place, believed by our
coolies, as it happens, to be the resort of robbers.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding all this the desire to learn and
the honour for learning seem almost to overtop the
desire for money in a Chinaman's breast, and it is
difficult to see that there is not some special significance
in the curious fact, in regard to the worship of
Confucius, that he was once worshipped as a duke, at
another time as a prince, then as an emperor, after
which his rank was, what we should call, lowered, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
he was honoured as "the most wise ancestral teacher
Confucius."</p>

<p>Confucius is still their master in preference to
Laotze, whom Confucius himself compared to a dragon,
and whose writings are so spiritual as to approach closer
to the Gospel of St. John than anything else. Both
write about "The Way," or, as Laotze calls it, <i>Tao</i>, on
which word alone whole volumes have been written. Yet
I see, in a note made at the time of a visit, I wrote:
"A party of young Chinese called to-day, all ready
for their degrees, preparing for the mandarinate, and
in the meantime <i>schwa</i>-ing for a few days in a neighbouring
guild garden. They had seen the newly arrived
Japanese consular officials. One of them said he had
read the <i>Tao-teh-ching</i>, Laotze's great book, and praised
it as very beautiful. But the nearest they got to a
sensible remark was: 'We do not like our women
to walk about. Do women with you study equally
with men? With us very few can read. I think it
is a good thing they should study.' This last clause,
though, said timorously, rather more as a feeler than
as a decided expression of the speaker's convictions.
They went away with some copies of Pastor Kranz's
admirable pamphlet against footbinding, which they
at once looked into, and pronounced very good. But
it was curious to notice how eager they were to learn
who the writer was."</p>

<img src="images/i_0324.jpg" width="550" height="373" alt="" />
<p class="caption">APPROACH TO CONFUCIUS' GRAVE.</p>
</div>

<p>And now how can one dismiss the literati without
a remark upon Chinese dress? Louis le Comte, Jesuit
and Confessor to the Duchess of Burgundy, makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
such quaint comments upon it in his letters, written
in 1687, I prefer to quote from them; for although
they are steadily shortening their jackets and narrowing
their sleeves, thus approximating more and more to
the European style, the Chinese, having once thought
out the best style of dress for their habits and climate,
adhere to it still. Father le Comte, writing of their
caps, says: "They add also a great flake of red silk,
which, hanging irregularly, gives a particularly pleasing
grace as the head moves." I have never quite seen
it in this way, but, thanks to the good Father, I hope
to notice this "pleasing grace" when I return to China.
"In riding they wear a sort of long hair, dyed of a
brisk shining red, which rain will not deface. It grows
white upon the legs of cows in Szechuan, and, receiving
this tincture, is dearer than the finest silk." This must
evidently be off Tibetan yaks' legs, and is very familiar
to me, and also I think very effective. "In summer
their neck appears bare, and is no good sight." I
quite agree with the Father here; in fact, the more a
Chinaman's person is covered up the better, I always
think. Their brocades and furs are a "very good
sight." "They wear boots always; and when any
person visits them, if they have not their boots on,
they will make them wait till they go and fetch them."
But this probably is rather true of officials than of
literati.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must say I like the young literati
of China. They seem to me very much like the
young men of other nations, except that they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
more easily amused, and amuse me less. I am told
they hate foreigners and are very dissipated. It may
be so, but they seem to me very good-humoured and
easy-going. They love fine clothes, and are sometimes
very smartly dressed; and they are on the whole cleaner
and somewhat nicer in their ways than the rest of the
community. The hope of China, I think, is in the
young literati. But I can quite understand that they
do not show their best side to missionaries, any more
than rather arrogant young agnostics, fresh from the
learning of the schools, would to hard-working Evangelical
curates, if such curates exist still in England.
I have no doubt, however, they are not really quite as
nice as they seem to be. Perhaps, however, that is
true of all young men.</p>

<p class="center p4">
MEMORIAL OF PRINCE KUNG ON THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF A COLLEGE FOR THE CULTIVATION
OF WESTERN SCIENCE (1887).</p>

<p>Your Majesty's servant and other Ministers of the
Council for Foreign Affairs on their knees present
this memorial in regard to regulations for teaching
Astronomy and the selection of students.</p>

<p>The sciences being indispensable to the understanding
of machinery and the manufacture of firearms,
we have resolved on erecting for this purpose a special
department in the Tung-wen College, to which scholars
of a high grade may be admitted, and in which men
from the West shall be invited to give instruction.</p>

<p>The scheme having met with your Majesty's
approval, we beg to state that it did not originate in
a fondness for novelties, or in admiration for the
abstract subtleties of Western science, but solely from
the consideration that the mechanical arts of the West
all have their source in the science of Mathematics.
Now, if the Chinese Government desires to introduce
the building of steamers and construction of machinery,
and yet declines to borrow instruction from the men
of the West, there is danger lest, following our own
ideas, we should squander funds to no purpose.</p>

<p>We have weighed the matter maturely before
laying it before the Throne. But among persons who
are unacquainted with the subject there are some who
will regard this matter as unimportant; some who will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
censure us as wrong in abandoning the methods of
China for those of the West; and some who will even
denounce the proposal that Chinese should submit to
be instructed by people of the West as shameful in
the extreme. Those who urge such objections are
ignorant of the demands of the times.</p>

<p>In the first place it is high time that some plan
should be devised for infusing new elements of strength
into the government of China. Those who understand
the times are of opinion that the only way of effecting
this is to introduce the learning and mechanical arts
of Western nations. Provincial governors, such as Tso
Tsung-tang and Li Hung-chang, are firm in this conviction,
and constantly presenting it in their addresses
to the Throne. The last-mentioned officer last year
opened an arsenal for the manufacture of arms, and
invited men and officers from the metropolitan garrison
to go there for instruction; while the other established
in Foochow a school for the study of foreign languages
and arts, with a view to the instruction of young men
in ship-building and the manufacture of engines. The
urgency of such studies is, therefore, an opinion which
is not confined to us, your servants.</p>

<p>Should it be said that the purchase of firearms
and steamers has been tried, and found to be both
cheap and convenient, so that we may spare ourselves
the trouble and expense of home production, we reply
that it is not merely the manufacture of arms and
the construction of ships that China needs to learn.
But in respect to these two objects, which is the
wiser course, in view of the future&mdash;to content ourselves
with purchase, and leave the source of supply in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
hands of others, or to render ourselves independent
by making ourselves masters of their arts&mdash;it is hardly
necessary to inquire.</p>

<p>As to the imputation of abandoning the methods
of China, is it not altogether a fictitious charge? For,
on inquiry, it will be found that Western science had
its root in the astronomy of China, which Western
scholars confess themselves to have derived from Eastern
lands. They have minds adapted to reasoning and
abstruse study, so that they were able to deduce from
it new arts which shed a lustre on those nations;
but, in reality, the original belonged to China, and
Europeans learned it from us. If, therefore, we
apply ourselves to those studies, our future progress
will be built on our own foundation. Having the root
in our possession, we shall not need to look to others
for assistance, an advantage which it is impossible to
over-estimate.</p>

<p>As to the value to be set on the science of the
West, your illustrious ancestor, Kang Hsi, gave it his
hearty approbation, promoting its teachers to offices of
conspicuous dignity, and employing them to prepare
the Imperial calendar; thus setting an example of
liberality equalled only by the vastness of his all-comprehending
wisdom. Our dynasty ought not to
forget its own precedents, especially in relation to a
matter which occupied the first place among the studies
of the ancients.</p>

<p>In olden times yeomen and common soldiers were
all acquainted with Astronomy; but in later ages an
interdict was put upon it, and those who cultivated
this branch of science became few. In the reign of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Kang Hsi the prohibition was removed, and astronomical
science once more began to flourish. Mathematics
were studied together with the classics, the evidence
of which we find in the published works of several
schools. A proverb says, "A thing unknown is a
scholar's shame." Now, when a man of letters, on
stepping from his door, raises his eyes to the stars,
and is unable to tell what they are, is not this enough
to make him blush? Even if no schools were established,
the educated ought to apply themselves to such
studies. How much more so when a goal is proposed
for them to aim at?</p>

<p>As to the allegation that it is a shame to learn
from the people of the West, this is the absurdest
charge of all. For, under the whole heaven, the deepest
disgrace is that of being content to lag in the rear
of others. For some tens of years the nations of the
West have applied themselves to the study of steam
navigation, each imitating the others, and daily producing
some new improvement. Recently, too, the
Government of Japan has sent men to England for
the purpose of acquiring the language and science of
Great Britain. This was with a view to the building
of steamers, and it will not be many years before they
succeed.</p>

<p>Of the jealous rivalry among the nations of the
Western Ocean it is unnecessary to speak; but when
so small a country as Japan is putting forth all its
energies, if China alone continues to tread indolently
in the beaten track, without a single effort in the way
of improvement, what can be more disgraceful than
this? Now, not to be ashamed of our inferiority, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
when a measure is proposed by which we may equal
or even surpass our neighbours, to object to the shame
of learning from them, and for ever refusing to learn,
to be content with our inferiority&mdash;is not such meanness
of spirit itself an indelible reproach?</p>

<p>If it be said that machinery belongs to artisans, and
that scholars should not condescend to such employments,
in answer to this we have a word to say. Why
is it that the book in the <i>Chao-li</i>, on the structure of
chariots, has for some thousands of years been a
recognised text-book in all the schools? Is it not
because, while mechanics do the work, scholars understand
the principles? When principles are understood,
their application can be extended. The object which
we propose for study to-day is the principles of things.
To invite educated men to enlarge the sphere of
their knowledge by investigating the laws of nature
is a very different thing from compelling them to take
hold of the tools of the working man. What other
point of doubt is left for us to clear up?</p>

<p>In conclusion we would say that the object of
study is utility, and its value must be judged by its
adaptation to the wants of the times. Outsiders may
vent their doubts and criticisms, but this measure is
one that calls for decisive action. Your servants have
considered it maturely. As the enterprise is a new
one, its principles ought to be carefully examined. To
stimulate candidates to enter in earnest on the proposed
curriculum, they ought to have a liberal allowance from
the public treasury to defray their current expenses, and
have the door of promotion set wide open before them.
We have accordingly agreed on six regulations, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
we herewith submit to the eye of your Majesty, and
wait reverently for the Imperial sanction.</p>

<p>We are of opinion that the junior members of
the Hanlin Institute, being men of superior attainments,
while their duties are not onerous, if they were appointed
to study Astronomy and Mathematics, would find those
sciences an easy acquisition. With regard to scholars
of the second and third grades, as also mandarins of
the lower ranks, we request your Majesty to open the
portals and admit them to be examined as candidates,
that we may have a larger number from whom to select
men of ability for the public service.</p>

<p>Laying this memorial before the Throne, we beseech
the Empresses-Regent and the Emperor to cast on it
their sacred glance, and to give us their instructions.

<p>Some extracts from a Chinese father's letters to
his son will probably do more to explain what is
thought admirable in a Chinese young man than pages of
commentary. The son in this case was the late Marquis
Tseng, during many years Chinese Minister in London.
The writer was his father, the celebrated Tseng Kuo
Fan, in whose honour a temple has been put up at
Wuchang opposite Hankow. Grandson of a Hunan
farmer, son of a humble scholar, this Chinese Chesterfield
passed his first examination at twenty-one; and
continuing steadily to pass examinations, he was a
Hanlin student at twenty-eight, Chief Examiner for the
Province of Szechuan at thirty-two, Deputy-Supervisor
of Instruction in Peking, and nominally in charge of
the education of the future Emperor at thirty-four.
During the Taiping rebellion he had to become a
General; and it was during all the troubles of this
rebellion his letters were written. It was his devoted
brother, then a Viceroy, who published the Life and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Writings of Tseng Kuo Fan. The latter, just as his
son was becoming a man, wrote to him as follows:</p>

<p>"From my earliest years I have been a student of
the ancient sages. Among their thousand words and
myriad sayings there is no sentence more striking or
suggestive than the little phrase of four characters,
<i>pu chi, pu ch`in</i> (neither envious nor fawning). <i>Chi</i>
means to be envious of the virtuous, and malignant
towards the influential. The fact that any one lacks the
spirit or the ambition to walk in the path of rectitude
is no reason why he should be afraid of the success of
others. <i>Ch`in</i> means that you will sink all to gain name
and wealth, and then be in a constant state of unrest
lest these treasures should be lost. Such a disposition
as either the former or the latter is the characteristic
of the 'small man.' As Viceroy of Chihli I constantly
see men of equal rank and abilities manifesting a spirit
of envy, animated only by the spirit of self-seeking and
suspicion. If you desire to secure happiness in this
life, you must get rid of the spirit of envy. If you
desire to act properly and set a good example, you must
abhor the character of the sycophant. The one leads
to the other's injury, and the other is the spirit of the
robber. I dare not affirm that I have swept my heart
of these two evils; but I wish, nevertheless, to warn
you and your brothers of these deformities."</p>

<p>Here is a characteristic bit of Chinese advice:</p>

<p>"With regard to your walking, I observe that your
manner is too animated. Are you more quiet now?
Your utterance is also far too rapid for clearness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
pronunciation. You should cultivate more repose of
manner. Are you improving in these two respects?
These two cautions you are to keep constantly in mind,
and see if you cannot make a change for the better."</p>

<p>One has constantly to remind oneself in China that
the stolidity one sees around one is assumed in accordance
with etiquette, and that in reality far more emotion
is felt than shown in a land where only street arabs
dare to be altogether natural and smile when they see
one.</p>

<p>In all the throes of the revolution the busy statesman
yet had time to think, like Mr. Gladstone, of <i>la
petite culture</i>:</p>

<p>"I think it would be well for you to select several
plots of land, and devote them exclusively to the
raising of vegetables. At our cantonments I have
turned many of our braves into gardeners. The land
has been laid out in beds thirty feet by five, separated
by paths and little water-ways, so that the vegetables
should not be drowned after heavy rains. In the
province of Szechuan I first saw gardening of this kind.
The processes of irrigation are there carried to great
perfection; and they seem certainly to have caught the
ideas and practice of the ancients. In our region of the
country very little land is set aside for the cultivation
of vegetables. I wish my family to set the precedent
of taking seemingly sterile tracts of mountainous land
or wet, marshy places, and making them useful in raising
fruit and vegetables. Though the cultivation of tea
may yield greater profit in some of the valleys, yet I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
am convinced if my scheme is carried out no one
need complain of poverty in all that region. All that
is needed is to be judicious and persevering."</p>

<p>But his letter on hearing of his son's marriage is
more striking. It will be observed there is no comment
on either the looks or character of the new bride,
no hope ever expressed that she may be such as to
conduce to his son's happiness. Any such idea would
be strange to a Chinaman:</p>

<p>"Your letter containing an account of your marriage
has been duly received. It will be a great pleasure
to your mother to have a daughter-in-law. I am also
greatly rejoiced that the affair is so happily ended.
Now that your household is established, it behoves
you to follow the example of successful men in regulating
your domestic affairs. One habit to be especially
cultivated is that of early rising. In summer and
winter alike in our family our ancestors were never
in bed after four o'clock in the morning. My great-grandfather,
Ching Hsi-kung, and grandfather, Hsing
Kang-kung, usually arose before daylight in all seasons
of the year. My father, Chu T`ing-kung, if he had
any important business on hand, would often rise
once or twice during the night, and begin operations
often before dawn. You yourself can bear witness
to that fact. I trust that these family habits, which
have been conserved with such good effects these
many generations, will not be discontinued. You
should set an example of early rising, diligence in
business, and perseverance before your wife, and thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
lead her to cultivate the same virtues. Here, as in
all things, practice makes perfect. As to myself, I
have found that when I lacked in perseverance nothing
was completed, and character as well as business
suffered. This I consider disgraceful in the extreme.
Afterwards, when appointed to military command, I
made up my mind to execute my sovereign's will to
the best of my abilities. However, even in this good
purpose I regret that I have so often lagged, much
to my shame and discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I observe with respect to your general deportment
that you are too frivolous by far. This is a most
grievous defect. If there is one virtue more than
another which our ancestors emulated, it was that of
dignity. In everything it is proper that one observe
a decorous and dignified behaviour.</p>

<p>"These three admonitions, then, you are to keep
constantly in mind&mdash;namely, early rising, perseverance,
and decorum. Thus you will preserve the traditions
of the family, establish your own character, and that
of your household. Lack of perseverance is my
crowning defect, as levity is yours. By diligence in
the correction of these blemishes, we shall sustain the
habits and traditions of our ancestors, cover up my
past deficiencies, and complete your own character,
which is my highest desire for you. By thus setting
an example before your younger brother, you will do
more to bring good fortune to the family than in any
other way.</p>

<p>"In view of the removal of your uncle to another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
place, you are now in the responsible position of head
of the family. Our ancestor, Hsing Kang, was very
particular in the management of his family. There
were four things which he insisted upon as of prime
importance&mdash;namely, early rising, cleanliness, the continuance
of the practice of ancestral worship, and,
fourthly, wisdom in intercourse with our relatives and
neighbours. If they are in trouble, you are always to
be ready to lend assistance, and also to rejoice with
them in their joy. If they are estranged, you are to
act the part of peacemaker. In sickness you are to
manifest sympathetic interest, and at funerals you are
to offer condolences. These four things, together with
your studies and the cultivation of the garden, are to
be kept constantly before your mind, and diligently
observed. If because of your studies you cannot
attend to these various duties, you are still to keep a
general oversight, and be well informed as to what is
going on.</p>

<p>"With reference to family worship, your mother is
to be specially careful to reserve the best utensils in
the house for that purpose; also the best of the food
and drink are to be used. No family can expect
long continuance of prosperity or life which neglects
these important particulars."</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind this is the letter of a
follower of Confucius and a member of China's most
learned Hanlin College; yet he does not treat family
worship and the utensils to be used for it as otherwise
than "most important."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>It might be a busy London lawyer writing this
advice to his son on study:</p>

<p>"The present will be a good time for you to read
extensively in miscellaneous literature, and add to your
general information on all subjects. It is most difficult
in this busy and confused world to get time for quiet
study and meditation. When the opportunity is given
you, you should by no means allow it to pass unheeded.
On the 16th of next month I expect to start from
Nanking on a tour of inspection up and down the
river, and may not return till the end of the month.
It will give me the greatest pleasure to hear of your
perseverance in study, and I trust you will continuously
put forth your powers in the line of intellectual
advancement."</p>

<p>After noticing the simplicity of spirit and careful
attention to details in these letters, it is touching to
read this later one:</p>

<p class="i2">
"<span class="smcap">To my Son Chi-tse</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>"For successive years I have had my memorials
to the Throne copied and filed away. I am now selecting
the more important ones to be carefully copied for your
use. Together with my letters I trust you will have
them carefully deposited at home, so that they can be
handed down from generation to generation of our
descendants. But the letters to you and your brothers
especially are on no account to be cut in boards or
printed for the perusal of others. Very few of these
letters or memorials are worthy of public notice. The
series of essays and poems which I have written after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
the style of the ancient worthies, and collected in a
volume entitled <i>Li T`uan Chai</i>, has been copied, and
can be given to others for inspection. It will soon be
printed, and disposed of for general circulation. But
the letters, memorials, and essays outside of that volume
are to be sacredly preserved. Some of these were
written when I was a young man, and my style was
unformed. Their publication would bring no glory to
the family. If any of our friends should crave their
perusal, you will in courteous language decline to allow
them to be seen."</p>

<p>His directions were disregarded, or we should not
have these letters. There is a whole book full of
them; but these few extracts will give some insight into
the nature of a very exemplary Chinese father's admonitions,
perhaps even more from what he leaves out than
from what he says. The son thus carefully trained
seems in every way to have done credit to his father.
One of his sons, again a lad of singular charm and
great promise, died early; another seems more pleasant
than distinguished. His nephew and adopted son is
one of the prominent, though possibly not leading,
members of the party of progress in Shanghai.

Particoloured Cliff.
</p>
</div>

<p>The country round Ichang has always some special
beauty, and in autumn it is the tints, shown to
especial advantage on the tallow-trees. But one day
we gathered by the wayside lovely anemones, still
lingering on in sheltered spots; large gentians, with
their edges picked out into delicate feathery streamers
such as one finds in picotees, the little yellow originator
of all the garden chrysanthemums; China asters; China
daisies; the cunningly placed red berries of the spindle-tree;
and branches crowded with the fairylike red
berries of the Chinese hawthorn. And yet we were
in the weird, arid, conglomerate region, where, as the
botanist of the party said, no flower would dream of
growing that could grow anywhere else. The Cherokee
roses were no longer in bloom. Are these innocent,
white, large roses at the bottom of the American horror
of Chinese immigration? It may be remembered that,
originating from China, they spread over America with
such rapidity that it was assumed they must be of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
native origin, and from their aggressive nature they
were given the name, by which they are still known,
of Cherokee.</p>

<p>We made our way to my first monastery, so
conspicuous an object to every visitor to these regions,
planted on a rocky spur of about fifteen hundred feet
high, that not only overhangs precipitously the country
beneath, but is separated by a chasm of some one
thousand feet from the adjoining hills. Crossing this
chasm on a rock bridge about three feet wide, and,
as usual in China, railless, required more nerve than one
of our party possessed, and the subsequent climb was
more trying still up the steps cut out of the steep rock
on to the Buddhist temple, that appropriately crowns the
whole summit, and which, were it in any more accessible
region, would have been "photographed like this and
photographed like that," like any professional beauty.
As it was, I had never seen a picture of it, and was quite
eager to take my camera to photograph the mountain-top,
as also the massive wall of conglomerate rock
that builds up the <i>col</i> one has to climb in ascending,
and from which one obtains one of those extraordinary
desolate views characteristic of conglomerate
country&mdash;a valley ending in an abrupt gully with
dry waterbed, and dry waterfalls down precipices
marked with pudding-holes, all scoring parallel horizontal
lines across their stern surfaces. We came across
brecciated conglomerate in which there were some bits of
most exquisite glistening marble, and in which we again
noticed the peculiarity, that at every fracture it was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
marble and stones, of which it was formed, that were
cleft through the middle, as evidently more breakable
than the apparently soft-looking red cement that bound
them together.</p>

<p>The way up was beautiful. We passed by picturesque
farmsteads nestling in hollows, elegant shrines,
and the grove the Reeves' pheasants particularly love.
It is of pendulous cypress, called <i>funebris</i>, but suggesting
anything but funereal associations by its pleasing
grace. Palm-trees grew on the hillside, also bamboo,
cunninghamia, ilex, and beautiful soap-trees, with the
great long pods from which the soap is made, and
tree-like thorns projecting from their stems, such as
must effectually baffle any monkey-climbers. In four
examples we saw these thorn branches had again
other thorns projecting from them. The path is an
easy one, carefully laid out by the priests for the
convenience of pilgrims; and although there must
be over five hundred steps, they do not come all
together; so that few climbs of equal height can be so
easily managed as that to the monastery of Yuen Ti
Kuan, whose site, if paralleled, could hardly be surpassed.
It is like that of some wild eyrie on which
an eagle might be expected to build its nest, but
where we should hardly expect practical, prosaic (so
called) Chinamen to build a place of worship, simply
to give themselves the further additional trouble of
climbing so high. It seems that after all the Chinese
have a religion of their own, which they deem holy,
though it is often convenient to ignore this. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
many Shansi men in these parts, and one of our fellow-travellers,
a man from Shansi, being asked why this
was, when his province used formerly to be the
granary of the empire, replied at once, "The hearts
of the people have become corrupted."</p>

<p>As we came back, there were about four miles of
little lanterns floating down the great river, sped in
honour of the dead by a rich Chinese in mourning
for his parents. Talleyrand's somewhat brutal "Il
faut oublier les morts, et s'occuper des vivants" often
recurs to me in China, where there are more grave-mounds
round the city than living men inside it. The
very handsome old Italian Bishop used to hate these
grave-mounds, which he said oppressed him the more
the longer he looked at them, and among which, alas!
he was doomed to live and die.</p>

<p>It was near Ningpo I first assisted at a Chinese
Buddhist service. We had been straying over hills
pink and red and orange and mauve with azaleas in
their full delicate bloom and perfect beauty. The most
exquisite bush of pink azaleas hung over the great
waterfall there, and caught some of the spray upon its
blossoms, as the stream turned over the edge for its
first leap, the flowers constantly wavering with the
breeze the rushing waters brought. Wandering by
lovely Windermere's side in the English Lake District,
I had read Miss Gordon Cumming's description of
hillsides striped and banded in colour with azaleas, and
thought some day I too must see them. The seasons
had rolled round but twice, and now here was I already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
tired of pink azaleas, which I decided looked too smart
on a mountain-side, and preferring the big orange
flowers or the deep red, or revelling in the long
clusters of sweet-scented wistaria, that hung about like
lovely ringlets; looking with exultation at osmundias
curving their opening fronds with the full vigour and
health imparted to them by the spring, and delighting
in the clumps of feathery bamboos, golden stemmed
old friends of my childhood; yet admiring almost equally
<i>Cunninghamia sinensis</i> on its native heath. We plant
little saplings of this last in our gardens, and boast
with them even then. Here they were tall and vigorous,
and everywhere giving an Oriental character to the
ferns and the azaleas, the bamboos and fan-palms.</p>

<p class="caption">NEAR NINGPO.</p>
</div>

<p>Then the rich, sweet tones of the Buddhist bell
summoned us, and we slept, as it were prisoned,
within the dark precincts of the monastery, not even
through latticed windows catching any glimpse of
outside glories, till solemn sounds roused me in the
early dawning, and I stole in at the back of the dark
temple, and could hardly believe I was not in one of
the Portuguese churches of my childhood. There knelt
the priests, with close-shaven heads, and long cloaks
broached across the left breast, leaving the right arm bare,
and formed of little oblong bits of old gold or ashen
grey linen, neatly stitched together, thus symbolising at
some expenditure of pains the poverty of rags. They
prostrated themselves three times, touching their foreheads
to the ground&mdash;before the altar, was it not?
They bowed and knelt before the <i>altar</i>! They elevated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
the Host, or at least a cup, one ringing a bell meanwhile,
the others prostrate in adoration. Could the
resemblance be more perfect? They chanted a monotonous
chant&mdash;it sounded to me just like a Gregorian&mdash;and
after many bowings and prostrations and beatings of a
dull wooden gong in the form of a skull, processioned
round and round before the altar, bowing as they
passed, each a rosary at his side, and solemnly chanting.
There seemed to be no doubt about the words; I
heard them quite distinctly: "Domine, ora pro nobis,
ora, ora." Then "Gloria! gloria!" swelled out. And
meanwhile, though passing me at intervals so closely I
almost felt the <i>frou-frou</i> of their robes, not a priest
there seemed to perceive my presence, but all went
by with eyes on the ground, fingers and palms close
pressed together. A strange feeling came over me,
as if I were dreaming. Had the azaleas intoxicated
me? Was I in far-away Madeira of my childhood?
Were those not Portuguese Roman Catholic priests,
not Chinese Buddhists? Were they praying really?
To our Father in heaven? Or are there more gods
than one? If not, they were worshipping, and I was
not. And had this worship gone on after this fashion
for thousands of years, before even Christ walked the
earth, and lived and died for man? I knelt in prayer
behind the Buddhist priests. And then I saw the
figure of the Virgin with the Holy Child upon her
knee. They call her Kwanyin (Goddess of Mercy).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0352" id="i_0352"></a>
<img src="images/i_0352.jpg" width="462" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SALISBURIA ADIANTIFOLIA.<br />
<i>From Picture by Chinese Artist.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Outside the door stood two beautiful <i>Salisburia
adiantifolia</i>, the sacred tree of the Japanese. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
breeze rustled through their graceful leaves, resembling
the lobes of the maidenhair, and I felt that they could
tell me all about it, if they pleased, for they had grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
up amongst it. The blue sky overhead tells no tales,
and the azaleas were of yesterday. Then a young
priest came up to question me, and to ask me if I
could say "Omito Fo." "Blessed is Buddha" I took it
to mean; and assuredly he must be blessed, if ever
man were, for the good that he has done for his kind.
But since then I hear that learned men attribute various
meanings to the phrase, and their meanings I do not
understand. Nor, I am sure, would those priests. They
did not look so very clever. I meant what they meant.
"Our temple wants new tiles, Omito Fo." "We are
very poor, Omito Fo." Praise God Barebones meant the
same, I fancy, by his "Praise God." "But Buddha was
a man," I hear some one say. Well! then go to
Tibet, and tell me what the uninstructed but beautiful
Tibetan means, as he walks along the street murmuring,
"Om Mani Padmi Hum." "The Jewel is in
the Lotus?" What does he mean by saying it, wise
man? I do not ask what you think the words may
originally have signified or symbolised. Is it not
now simply a "Praise the Lord of Life"?</p>

<p>The next monastery we visited was the stately
T`ien Dong. Avenues of magnificent trees led up to
squares with giant trees enclosing them, terraces, and
ponds covered with the sacred lotus. The entrance
and approach prepared one for more than man could
ever realise inside. The Parthenon would have looked
small and the Pantheon empty after that approach.
As it was, I certainly did not think much of the
temples, and the guest-rooms were dark. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
trees behind were beautiful, and had enticing paths
leading on into the wood. There was a very well-dressed
Chinaman going in. He turned out to be the
captain of a man-of-war. I have often pleased myself
since by believing he was Captain, afterwards Admiral,
Ting. He asked if we should like to be introduced
to his particular friend the chief priest. Within the
inner courts there was a blush-rose peony-plant covered
with blossom. Before this the post-captain stood in
rapt adoration. It was evident that he had really
brought us to show us this, as one of the wonders of
the world. The Chinese especially esteem peonies of
this shade of colour. And it was indeed a lovely
sight, and must have carried off the prize at any
show at which it was exhibited, so carefully had it
been grown, and so completely was it covered with
blossom. But I had seen flowers before, never a
Buddhist high-priest, nor a Chinese post-captain. The
latter led us into the pleasant reception-room. On
the couch sulked a mandarin we had met several times
already, always wearing a scowl, and a magnificent
gown of cream satin richly embossed. He scowled
now, and without a feint of courtesy of any kind at
once seated himself in the seat of honour. Then the
chief priest came in, with nothing to indicate his grandeur
beyond particularly civil manners. He had also a
bustling cheeriness, which was probably all his own,
not belonging to his office, as he begged us to sit at
the round table, and partake of the various sweets
with which it was spread. Delicious tea was brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
in, of a kind very costly even in China, scented with
jasmine flowers. Then, having dispensed hospitalities,
pointed out the peony, and generally made us welcome,
the chief priest bustled away, carrying off the post-captain
into some inner apartment. And a comfortable-looking
Ningpo merchant, spending a few days at the
temple with his family, with that geniality that seems
to be a Ningpo characteristic, began to introduce the
various members of his family, and generally make
friends. But the cream-coated gentleman still sat and
scowled. It was disagreeable; and so, though every
one says one cannot, I determined to treat this scornful
mandarin as if he were after all a human being. And
looking round with a bow and a smile, as if I had never
noticed his rudeness, I took the seat indicated to me
at the table, at which he had already seated himself.
After all a mandarin is human. He looked surprised
of course, but smiled too; and after that we saw his
scowl no more, but received a very polite bow and
smile, when after a little while he in his turn went away.</p>

<p>Years passed, and I saw no more of monasteries
till we went to Omi's sacred mountain in the far, far
west of China.</p>

<p>At one temple, at which we tried to spend the
night, we were met by point-blank refusal. The priests
said their rooms were full. We might have believed
them, had they risen to receive us and offered us tea.
But meeting with cold incivility, we believed rather
the Temple of the Elephants' Pool was too rich to be
beguiled by foreign offerings into receiving heretics, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
we pushed on through the gathering night and rising
mist up and up along a <i>col</i>-like knife-edge and by
beautiful trees to a little temple, where they did their
best to make us comfortable according to our to them
most strange tastes, and then begged like beggars for
some of my husband's clothes, because the young priest
in charge of the temple had set his foolish fancy on
trying foreign clothes, and like a child could not be
turned from his point.</p>

<p>At the top of the mountain we spent a fortnight
in the Golden Monastery. The priest whose especial
duty it was to entertain strangers received us from
the first with great courtesy, but he informed us that
anything we ate must be eaten in the privacy of
our own apartment. And as at first we had none
(for we could not, till we had tried all round and
failed, resign ourselves to one room giving on to
the mountain-side, out of which it had been dug,
and with only one window, that did not open), this
resulted in our taking our first meal upon the mountain-top
<i>al fresco</i> on the grass, the monastery, however, very
kindly supplying us with hot water for our tea. Then,
finding no other temple could or would receive us,
we promised to take no life whilst upon the sacred
mountain, and only to eat our shocking foreign food
in the one room assigned to us, having it cooked in
the adjoining one, given over to our two servants and
eight coolies. The priests used to come in and out all
day, and offer us tea and sweetmeats; but they never
would even drink tea out of our cups, for fear of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
defilement of previous milk still clinging round them.
That monastery struck us as both strict and carefully
managed, the chief priest, who had the air and bearing
of a saint, spending hours in solitary devotion in the
temple on the verge of the great precipice.</p>

<p>All the temples on the mountain's top were burnt
down a few years ago. But the exquisite Bronze
Temple, on the edge of the precipice, to which every
province in the empire contributed, has never been
rebuilt after its sad destruction, beautiful fragments
alone remaining; and the rough pine-wood temples
round it appeared all at daggers drawn. Our Golden
Temple was bringing an action against another for
placing a golden pinnacle as the centre ornament of
its roof, thus building up a pretext to filch from it its
immemorial golden title; whilst another temple accused
ours of having intentionally lit the fire that consumed
it. We did not believe this of our temple, for even
its boy priests were hard-working, good little boys,
who knelt and burnt incense with reverence too; whilst
the young priests of the adjoining temples were bold,
bad youths, of ribald laughter, importunate curiosity,
and great effrontery. There was, however, one temple
where the priests appeared always wrapped in devotion,
whenever I looked in. They had not yet begun rebuilding,
perhaps were still praying for funds, as they
knelt among their burnt and charred images.</p>

<p>There were outlying temples on distant points of
vantage, each inhabited by a solitary priest. One had
long attracted us by its exquisite neatness, and the propriety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
and cleanliness of its arrangements. Its occupant
was away on a pilgrimage, but he returned before we
left the mountain, and we were not surprised to find him
a young man of great gravity and much courtesy. We
had already studied his kitchen, with its kettle hanging
from the rafters by a chain and a jointed stick; also
observed his closet-bed, which, in accordance with the
stricter rule, was but a wooden seat, so that neither
day nor night could he lie down. We now saw how
carefully washed were the feet in his straw sandals;
also what superior straw sandals he had brought up
to sell to pilgrims who had worn out theirs; and how
particular he was to make no profit upon the transaction,
when we bought a pair, and inadvertently slightly
overpaid for them. But our acquaintance was not long
or intimate enough to arrive at anything of the spiritual
life beneath that exterior propriety. He it was who
told us there was a way down the back of the mountain
into the Wilderness, where the wild cattle roam, and
that, though bad, he could not say other than that it
was possible, seeing he had just passed along it&mdash;this
though he could see our coolies' imploring gestures, and
hear their rather audibly muttered curses. They had
every one of them sworn there was no path. But there
was, and the young hermit could not say otherwise.
We often thought of him, as we all fell headlong
going down that path, that certainly did exist, and
enabled us to proceed to our next sacred mountain
without descending into the burning, cholera-stricken
country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<p>There were only three priests at the temple on the
Sai King Shan. One was old and useless; one was
shivering with ague, which seemed strangely out of
place on the mountain; but we did not learn how
long he had been there&mdash;only relieved him with quinine.
And the whole work and administration seemed to be
carried on by the young priest, who had led us up
the mountain, and who by various begging excursions
had amassed enough money to buy it for four hundred
gold dollars, so as to save it from the havoc of the
wood-cutters, who had for years past been cutting
down all the trees. This young priest took care of
the potatoes, collected the mushrooms that made such
an exquisite symphony in cream and brown when spread
out in the sunshine to dry, and did everything, it seemed,
that was done. But we could not find out that religious
services were among the number. It was the aged
priest who lit sticks of incense before the images in
the morning.</p>

<p>Since then, however, we have stayed in a monastery
with which his and the Golden Temple on Omi both
are associated. The Monastery of the Particoloured
Cliff is only about fifteen miles from Chungking. The
entrance is at once striking, from the perspective of
the carefully planted shrubs, the flights of steps, the
carvings, and careful adjusting of the path, with sudden
corners, so that it never leads straight onward, admitting
free access to evil spirits. This is a prevalent Chinese
superstition, leading to the almost universal practice of
placing screens across their entrances either within or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
without. It is a part of their <i>Fung shui</i>, their wind
and water religion.</p>

<p>Much etiquette was observed in the method of our
admission into Hoa Ngai. We brought gifts, as we
were told was the usage. And polite monks received
us, and bade us wait first in one reception-room, then
in another, whilst higher and higher dignitaries were
brought to parley with us. Finally we were conducted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
through a long outlying wing, the strangers' quarter,
and led through one or two bedrooms, all full of
beds, carefully curtained, and each bed with rolls of
most comfortable-looking wadded quilts, evidently quite
new and fresh, from the brightness of their scarlet
colour&mdash;a gift from some recent wealthy guest, we
were informed. The floors were clean; everything was
in order&mdash;no dust anywhere; and the attendants at once
swift and quiet in making all those last final arrangements,
that must be deferred till the arrival of guests.
But best of all was the view from the window&mdash;the
peaceful sunset framed in a setting of trees, the
chastened lights and shadows, with the fresh country
air coming in so clean and pure through the open
window. But one must have lived in a Chinese city
to appreciate that as we did. The priests came to
and fro to inquire if we were content. Only after
some time did they signify that by their rules I must
not share that room with the wide-open window and
the peaceful outlook, but retire to the women's quarter,
all along the long corridor again, down an outside
staircase, along the corridor below, then through a
great door with many bolts into one bedroom leading
on into another, both full of beds, but otherwise untenanted,
and as clean as the rooms above, only without
a view, and with the dank smell of the earth outside,
instead of the fresh country air. Presently we were
asked to take tea with the priests&mdash;tea and many sweets.
A few priests were told off each day to prepare
special food for the guests&mdash;generally, of course, pious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
pilgrims, come to pray. There were over fifty priests
in all, and we saw the orders for the day hung up on
the wall, as if for a regiment. We also saw all the
others sitting at their severely simple meal, never
occupying opposite sides of the same table, but always
the same side of several tables; and in the midst to
the back on a raised seat the chief priest, not eating
with the others&mdash;he always ate apart&mdash;but sitting
there whilst they ate.</p>

<p>In the early dawning we had been each day
wakened by the call to prayers and the solemn chanting.
One day I sprang out of bed, and followed the
sound, which seemed to come from farther down the
corridor beyond my room, out of a side temple. Only
a few had assembled already, but priests continued
to come in till the chapel was full. None but a
few of the priest-boys paid any heed to my unaccustomed
presence, excepting the chief priest, when
he came in. He was an old man of over seventy, and
had now sat by at our evening meal more than once,
and talked with us&mdash;a great mark of condescension, we
were told, only shown to honoured guests. Presently
he came forward with a kindly smile, and, taking me
by the two shoulders, very kindly but firmly pressed
me into the place he desired me to occupy. And the
next minute I saw the reason of this. For, still chanting,
the monks began to procession round and round the
chapel, and in and out among the seats, forming the
most curious figures, and ever quicker and quicker, ever
with bowed heads, and fingers and palms pressed close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
together. The wild, simple chant rose and waned as
they processioned, close on fifty Chinese Buddhist priests,
moving as fast as ordinary people when they dance
the Caledonians, all chanting and not looking up. At
last I felt as if I could bear no more. It may have
been the early hour, the strange chant, the quick moving
to and fro. Anyhow, I tried to go to my husband's
room, and fell insensible on the stone passage just as
I reached the top of his staircase. I recovered consciousness
in an agony as to what Buddhist priests
might think suitable treatment for a fainting lady, if
they any of them found me there; and that gave me
strength to drag myself along to my husband's room.
They were chanting still, the sweet, wild music of the
chant softened by distance now, or I might have
thought it was all a dream, as I looked out upon the
gentle hills and sky framed in their setting of trees,
and breathed the fresh country air again.</p>

<p>They were very strict in that monastery; they would
not hear of our cooking anything for ourselves in our
own room, beyond boiling water for tea; but their
vegetarian diet quite satisfied all our wants. There
was some sort of chanting all day in the principal
temple&mdash;a droning kind of chanting, from certain priests
told off for the purpose. We often looked in; for,
uncommon enough, the central image was beautiful,
with a certain grave serenity. It was very ancient,
they told us. And we believed this. For the images
of to-day are made for money, and lack the air of
sanctity. This image recalled Byzantine pictures in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Russian churches&mdash;very
set, very
firm, yet withal so
kind, and above
all so holy.</p>

<p>But the really
ancient temple
was under the
over-hanging
cliff, from which
the whole place
is named, with the
water from that
cliff dripping over
it, and making
the steps by which
one ascends so
slippery one had
to walk warily.
There the images
were of the true
Indian type, with
supple, graceful
figures, erect carriage,
sloping
shoulders, and
small waists, all as
unlike the Chinese
figure as possible.
But perhaps the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
figure of Puhsien differed from the Chinese type
as much as anything by the seraphic smile, that seemed
to illumine even the dark cavern in which it was shrined.
Afterwards we saw Indian divinities, with low-necked
dresses and bare arms, an abomination in China, carved
on a headland of the Ya, by their Indian type showing
their great antiquity. Close by was the place where the
priests, when dead, are cremated. It seemed to have
been recently rebuilt. We also visited the chief priest's
grave, solemn by reason of its surrounding trees rather
than from its architectural adornments. But the most
striking feature of the whole place was its exquisite
cleanliness and propriety, and the perfect order in
all the land around, that belonged to the monastery,
and that might have been a model farm, so carefully
was it weeded and watered and tended. The chief
priest, as far as we could ascertain, was elected for
three years only, and our chief priest's time was nearly
drawing to an end; but before it did so he would
have the yearly ordination.</p>

<p>The monastery was exquisitely situated, partly on
a little knoll, partly on the more sloping side of the
hill. It and its outbuildings must have covered about
six or seven acres. And the sound of worship seemed
never silent there. But it was when we considered
how great must be the force religion brought to bear,
before out of such a slatternly, untidy, filth-loving
race as the Chinese it produced this spotless, orderly,
exemplary establishment, that we were perhaps most
impressed. And as we sat within those peaceful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
precincts, listening to the rich, deep sounds of Buddhist
bells, so far more musical than those of Europe, with the
hum of chanting penetrating to us, softened by distance,
and realised that this ancient worship dated from ages
ago, having been only reformed by Gautama&mdash;that
prince who gave up his father's throne, and the love
of father, wife, and child, to spend and be spent for
the people&mdash;it was impossible for us to believe that for
all those centuries God had left these people, trying
after it, without a way to approach Him, or that this
long-continued worship could be altogether unpleasing
to the Most High.</p>

</div>

<p>I have attended an ordination in St. John
Lateran's at Rome, of which my principal recollection
is how the Italian young men wriggled as they
all lay flat upon the marble floor whilst something was
sung over them. Was it a <i>Te Deum</i>? It certainly
was very long. The whole service, indeed, seemed
very long drawn out. I have also a remembrance of
nearly fainting from weariness at an ordination in
Exeter Cathedral; and can still recall the thrill of
awestruck admiration with which I regarded the reader
of the gospel on that occasion, who, as I understood,
had passed first, and who yet was overcome by
emotion, so far was he from esteeming himself worthy
of this honour, in thinking of the work that lay
before him. Certainly, long though the proceedings
were&mdash;and they must have been very long if they
seemed so to me, for in those days I was an enthusiast
about cathedral services&mdash;yet never for a second did
reverence of the highest quality cease to brood over
all the scene. Thus, when invited by the abbot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
himself to assist at an ordination in one of the strictest
of Chinese monasteries, there was some element of
wonder mixed with the fortitude with which I prepared
for a barbarous burning
rite, and <i>soupe maigre</i>
to see it on. Nor was
that flask of whisky
forgotten that is such a
support to the traveller,
remaining always full
under all emergencies
because never wanted.
It was not in this case.
But as the only European,
whose account of
such a ceremony I had
heard, reported two or
three monks carried away
fainting, and a general
odour of burning flesh,
I thought it might be.</p>

<p class="caption">AT FENGTU, CHINESE HADES.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The large beautifully situated monastery was already
full when I arrived; and my husband, who had transmitted
the abbot's invitation, and himself had been
there two days, informed me his was the only bed with
one man in it. "They sleep head and feet," he said,
as if this added to the comfort of it. "I can't think
where they will put you. They are very, very full; and
they are playing cards or smoking opium all the time
in my room. But they are very polite,&mdash;some one is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
always 'keeping me company.' I cannot read a word."
Indeed, he wore the dazed air of being too much kept
company with. At the head of a flight of steps, at
the entrance to the women's quarter, a dark den with
two beds was, however, found for me; and though
several ladies most obligingly offered to occupy the
other bed, and "keep me company" all night, I
retained undisturbed possession of the two, whenever
the door was barred. When it was not, people "kept
me company" (<i>pei</i>); ladies, priests, young men friends,
and young men who were not friends, but might
become such, all crowded in together with some young
monks, whose behaviour somewhat surprised me.</p>

<p>Attending meals of an abundant, yet meagre, description
with the other ladies, and returning the ladies'
calls, I was again and again surprised by the easy
behaviour of these young monks, who were apparently
especially taken by my gloves, and would feel my hand
gloved and feel my hand ungloved, and generally
<i>hang around</i>. One seemed very well brought up, and
began every sentence with "Omito!" generally finishing
it in that way too, and accompanying every remark by
a set little bow. We thought perhaps he was a lad&mdash;a
child&mdash;and my husband positively screamed when,
on being asked his age, he answered twenty-six. "Did
you ever see a young man of twenty-six with such an
innocent countenance?" he asked. "Well, I don't
know," I said evasively, "I suppose it is all right; but
I may as well tell you that never in all my life have
I had my hand squeezed as since I came into this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
monastery. They all do it, every one of them; so I
suppose it means nothing." I hastened to add, "But
they are in all the ladies' rooms too." "What! in the
Chinese ladies' too?" "Yes!" I persisted. "Oh,
well, well!" We resigned ourselves to the ways of
the country. It was not till two days later the truth
dawned upon us that this innocent-faced young man,
and some others, who were older and could hardly be
described in that way, were nuns, guests like ourselves,
and that there were besides sixteen young women going
to be made nuns, together with the fifty-two young
men who were going to be made priests. We were
so glad we found out.</p>

<p>All the day through there were invitations to tea
and sugar-plums with the abbot and past abbots (each
only rules for three years, and then retires into a
picturesque suite of rooms and garden to himself), and
all the while again and again sounds of gongs and drums
and chanting, and peeps at strange novices, young
people with shaven heads, clad in "Liberty-tinted"
gowns&mdash;dull red, ruddy brown, old gold, cream&mdash;kneeling,
or prostrating themselves quite flat, or winding in
and out with pacings and slow and quick movements.
On the morning of <i>the</i> day, after many services in the
night and dawning, there was the final shaving. Then
each knelt in turn, and had his head felt all over
the front, and with great care, by a seated priest with
immovable countenance of the Indian type, and long
taper, talonlike fingers. If a hair could be felt, back
to the barber! If quite smooth, little circles were traced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
with Indian ink upon the polled pate&mdash;this was done
by the eye, and often one had to be effaced and retraced;
then a tiny packet was handed to the kneeling one.
It was some time after this ceremony the abbot, in
dull cream, with over-gown of rich red satin, like the
others, all made of tiny bits sewn together to simulate
rags and poverty, and passed under the right arm, but
clasped over the left breast, black-hooded, and bearing
in lifted hand before his face a golden <i>jui</i>, or sceptre,
entered the large principal temple, and sat on a chair
placed upon the altar, a scourge borne behind him, draped
with red silk, being placed to his left, and what looked
like a censer to his right. Then four priests, with many
kneelings and flat prostrations, stood before the altar,
seven of the novices following in like fashion, and joining
the long line, seven at either end. Each carried a long
piece of cloth to spread upon the floor on which to lie
prostrate; and as the two lines stood facing each other
before the altar, the two in the centre raised the kneeling-cloth
to their eyes, and with it solemnly <i>tso-i'd</i> to
each other; then each, turning quickly to the right,
went through the same ceremony with the man he now
found himself confronted with; and so all along the
line, only the reverence growing less and less, till the
last man hardly got the cloth up as high as his shoulders,
for they had to be very quick. The wooden gong
was being beaten faster and faster. And now the
priests led off; and each set of nine, keeping to its own
side of the temple, went through the quickest "woven
paces" I have yet seen, curving in and round upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
one another, and round the huge stone monoliths that
support the vast graceful temple roof, whose erection
still remains a mystery, so lofty is it and so large its
span, so ample its unsupported roof-curves. It was
like the quickest possible follow-my-leader, so that the
end of the tail came up always smiling all over, and
breathlessly trying to get through the figure. Meanwhile,
at the side, towards the back, another dignitary
sat in state, and two novices knelt, and went flat, and
came forward, and practised taking incense-sticks from
the altar with fingers widely spread after a fashion that
does not look easy and does look mystic. But what
was the meaning of it, or the dance, no one seemed
able to say.</p>

<p>No number of inquiries, not even a direct letter
and special messenger to the monastery, had been
able to elicit even the day of the great ceremony,
much less the hour; but, since the evening before, we
had heard of two o'clock, and at two o'clock precisely
in they came. We ladies were crowding on to the
few seats in one corner; the male guests, silken-clad,
fur-lined, were swelling it about at the sides of the
temple, the centre of which appeared already quite filled
up by the priests of the monastery, and other priests
and men guests, who were all greeting one another,
going about, standing in groups, and generally wearing
a pleased, excited appearance. Meanwhile, the populace,
in serried mass, were looking in through all the
many half-doors on all sides, the tops of all the doors
being thrown wide open. There was music. Was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
it the wooden gong or the drum? It was quick, near.
It seemed to throb with the intense excitement pervading
the building. And in twenty minutes all was
over. Every one had come in, the abbot clad as before,
all the novices in over-gowns clasped over the left
shoulder&mdash;both over- and under-gowns of what we call
art colours. All had spread out their cloths and knelt
and prostrated themselves, before a priest took up his
position standing behind each, and extended both hands
to hold the novice's head quite steady, fingers wide
dispread, so as especially to shield the eyes, all of course
closed. Some adhesive mixture was applied to the
Indian ink circles; then a priest, standing in front of
each novice, took out of the packet previously given him
nice little cones of charred sandalwood and saltpetre,
and stuck them on the places indicated; and some one
else set them alight; and there were sixty-eight young
men and women, all kneeling, with their eyes closed,
their faces turned up to heaven, and with nine little
charcoal cones smouldering on each of their bare pates,
whilst they prayed one and all, as it seemed, with all
their hearts. For if the heart is pure, you do not suffer,
is the saying. My husband says he kept his eyes fixed
on the three nearest him, and never saw them wince,
or blanch, or utter a sound, or move a muscle. But
my place was by the nuns, and one moved, so that one
of the smouldering cones fell off and into her bosom,
and had to be replaced; and another did not cry out,
but roared&mdash;roared like a child. Yet such was the din
made by the excitingly discordant music, that when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
stepped but two off I could not hear a sound from her;
so there may have been many others crying out also. I
saw one nun press a cloth again and again to her eyes,
and take it away apparently soaked by her tears; but
her face was steady and upturned, and her expression
was that of very earnest prayer. Meanwhile, the cones
smouldered down till they just charred those marks
with which we are familiar on priests' heads; then
they went out, though all that day and on into the
next several little unburnt lumps were still adhering to
the poor consecrated heads.</p>

<p>We went away to tea and sugar-plums, leaving the
new-made monks and nuns still praying; and when
we came out, they had only adjourned to another temple
to pray. At ten o'clock at night they were calling on
Sergiafu (Buddha, Sakyamuni, what you will), thirty-four
standing up quite straight, chanting, whilst the other
thirty-four were lying prostrate, then going down in
their turn whilst the others rose up and chanted. This
they did at the rate of three prostrations and uprisings
a minute. They are supposed to make ten thousand
in the twenty days. It seemed to make me drowsy;
so, having twice fallen off asleep whilst they prayed
and rose and fell, I went to bed, leaving them still at
it, to be thrice awakened by the gong calling to fresh
prayers, and, when I arose the following morning, to
find the whole set processioning from one dead abbot's
grave to the other, praying at each. One of our Chinese
gentleman friends we left in the temple at night. At
eleven o'clock he was turning in. Then some one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
proposed ten more rounds of cards, and they played
till daybreak. It was only the week before we had
been invited to the funeral feast of his grandmother,
when, with the coffin in the guest-room, a light underneath
it, the ladies of the family played cards all night
in a bedroom opening out of the guest-room, though
their eyes were dilated either from tears or want of
sleep, their heads bound with white mourning-cloths of
the same coarse texture as those worn by the peasant.
Was it not something like this at one time in our own
country at a funeral feast?</p>

<p>Whilst in this monastery, we discovered another
mistake we had fallen into. We had long known this
friend as the honourable member of a certain mandarin
family, and often mused over the condition of affairs
it revealed,&mdash;that we knew, as we thought, six young
men of much the same age, all sons of one father, but
of different mothers. We had known them for years,
and had photographed the different mothers with their
sons, had assisted at their weddings and their funerals,
dined with them, and been dined by them, and often
speculated as to the character of the dead father and
the previous social status of his various wives. Now
Squire No. 4 proposed to take us to a breakfast party
at the country seat of Squire No. 2 in that neighbourhood,
on which a stiff cross-questioning arose; and at
last we discovered that the numbers indicated daughters
as well as sons, and amongst what we believed to be
brothers were three sets of cousins. "But we make
no distinction," said our friend suavely. "And you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
make no distinction between
elder brother and
younger? Strange, we
do." So it goes on.
Years in China only
serve to show one one's
mistakes.</p>

<p>"Pray come back, and
bring any of your friends
who would like to spend
a happy time here," were
the parting words of the
priests; whilst the nuns
assured us there was
going to be a much
grander ceremony on the
morrow, if only we would
stay for it, and we must
and should. But we had
gone through our purgatory
of intervening day
and night with a certain
object, which happily we
had gained, and could
endure no more. The
lady guests had been very kind to us. They assured
me they were strict vegetarians at home as well as
there, and were certainly devout and greatly interested
in the nuns, some coming forward to hold their heads
during the ordination ceremony. Two at least, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
appeared to be regular opium-smokers&mdash;they said
on account of illness. But it was impossible to detect
that they were in the least ashamed of smoking opium,
or that any one else, nun or priest or any one,
thought they had any reason to be. Yet this was a
very strict monastery, where neither wine nor flesh
meat was allowed. We noticed, moreover, that the
abbey lands were bright with healthy-looking opium
poppy-plants.</p>

<p>One further memory I have carried away. The
temple treasures were all set out for show on tables in
the men's guests' dining-hall, which looked out on to a
tiny shut-in garden, the walls of which were brightened
by tufts of Chinese primroses in full fragrant flower.
Gowns of many rich soft tints were hanging on racks
at one end, and the sun was streaming in upon embroideries
and satin vestments they were showing me,
when a dignitary, again of Indian type&mdash;long face,
very sad dreamy eyes, and high narrow forehead&mdash;came
in and arrayed himself in a gown of the most brilliant
orange silk; then, black-hooded, paused by a table,
and, bending slightly, referred to a large volume
lying upon it. The pose, the colouring, and the
lighting made one of those perfect little pictures
that one treasures in memory for years; and now,
when people denounce Buddhism to me, my mental
eye sees once more that living picture in vivid
orange and sunset-lit shadows, to which not the most
consummate artist could have added one touch without
injury.

<p>It was very hot in Chungking in 1892&mdash;too hot, we
feared, for us to bear, worn out as we were by the
emotions and excessive heat of the river journey, entered
upon too late in the summer. So, while we yet could,
we secured four bearer sedan-chairs, with blue cotton
awnings six yards long, after the fashion of this windless
province, and, with bath-towels to bind round our heads,
and sun-hats, and dark glasses, and all that following
necessary for a land journey of between twenty and
thirty men, were carried for a fortnight through a rich
agricultural district, a region of salt wells and petroleum
springs, on through the white-wax country to the foot
of sacred Omi. A letter written at the time to a cousin,
with whom I had two years before driven through our
own lovely Lake country, and who I knew shared
my delight in strange surroundings and the unexpected,
will best reproduce the exhilaration consequent
on emerging from the green luxuriance of semi-tropical
vegetation with its steamy hothouse air. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
written from our first resting-place upon the romantic
mountain-side.</p>

<p class="left45 p2">
"<span class="smcap">Wan Nien Sze</span>, <i>July 26th, 1892</i>.</p>

<p>"With whom do you think we have been lunching
to-day? I have had tea with gold-miners in Alaska,
and luncheon in a lumber camp in British Columbia,
and dinner with a party of Chinese merchants in Chungking;
but to-day, of all people in the world, it was
with the chief priest of a Buddhist monastery on the
sacred mountain of Omi! And very good the luncheon
was! I really felt <i>fed</i>&mdash;always a matter of question
when one is living upon tinned things. He did not
sit down with us; but he entertained us by his conversation,
and we had our own tablecloth and forks and
spoons, and our own servant to wait upon us. The
room was all set out with red cloths beautifully
embroidered in pale blue, hanging on the front of the
side-table, over the backs of the chairs, and down
from the seats, on which were cool summer cushions.
There were twelve courses besides the rice; and quite
a number of monks and pilgrims assembled to see
us eat. Our room opened into the temple, where
Puhsien (gigantic) sat upon the altar on a sort of leopard.
I believe some people say Puhsien was the son of
Sakyamuni or of Gautama, pronounce them how we
will. But the high-priest says, 'Omito Fo!' (Blessed
is Fu, or Buddha!) as a greeting, and interlards all his
talk with it: 'I am so glad you like your dinner,
Omito!' 'We are very poor; we want two hundred
thousand tiles to roof the temples, Omito!' etc., etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
We found <i>beignets</i> of pumpkin flowers in dough perfectly
delicious. But our man-servant says, 'Yes, but you
put in a catty [1&#8531; lb.] of flour, and you get only three
ounces.'</p>

<p>"It was a regular charity lunch; for directly it was
over the high-priest entered into further details,&mdash;how
the rooms we were lodging in wanted repairing,
and how everything did (which is quite true), and
how we could see every one who came to worship
was very poor, and the last Europeans who lodged
there gave about £15, and he thought it would be so
nice if we gave £25. And he brought the subscription
list out, and the brush to write with; and positively
would <i>not</i> let our Boy write down £2 10<i>s.</i>&mdash;twice as
large a sum as I thought necessary. Then another
priest begged too. They begged and begged, till I
said at last, determined to interrupt them, 'There is a
Tibetan image in the temple behind I do so want you
to come and show me.' Then every one burst out
laughing at such a very palpable attempt to change
the conversation. However, our modest sum got written
down, and the chief priest nearly wept. He came to
show us the Tibetan image, and he seemed to find it
absolutely uninteresting. It holds a little white rabbit
in one hand, and a rosary with very large beads in the
other, and looks as conceited as it is possible to look.
But as he said it was made on the mountain and not
in Tibet, we did not photograph it and him together.</p>

<p>"As far as we can make out, this mountain was
sacred long before Buddhism; and every day crowds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
pilgrims come&mdash;numbers of Chinese women, with their
bandaged feet wrapped up in husks of Indian corn to
make it easier to walk up the steep flights of steps that
lead up ten thousand feet to the top of the mountain.
How they manage it, I cannot think. The saying is, 'If
you are a bad man with sins unrepented, and go up
the mountain, you die.' Six men are
said to have thus died this year.
There is a wonderful bronze Puhsien
riding on a colossal bronze elephant,
beautifully made, each of its feet
standing on a lotus flower. This is
in a temple just behind ours, with a
dome, and made of bricks, both very
unusual in China, and said here never
to have been built, but to have come
in a single night.</p>

<p>"But I cannot tell you how I wish
to get away from all these temples.
They begin to oppress me so,&mdash;all
the people prostrating themselves, and then offering
incense before each image in turn (and there are so
many!), and lighting a candle before each. They arrive
with great baskets full. And they come out of the
temple with a rapt expression. And then our white
long-haired terrier springs out on them, and they
start so! We do not know what to do; because they
call him a lion-dog (he is the Chinese idea of a lion),
and seem to regard him as a semi-sacred thing. I do
not want him to go into the temples at all. And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
thresholds are so high he cannot get over; but there is
always some one who will hand him over, and then the
conceited dog shakes his sides and frisks about among
the worshippers. This worship has been going on for
thousands of years; and yet I do not believe any one
has an idea about Puhsien!</p>

<p>"Then there is Kwanyin over and over again, like
a Byzantine Virgin and Child, with a very sweet face
on this mountain, and a child on her knee. And women
come and pray for children, and carry away little dolls.
The more I think of it, the less I know what I believe
about it all. Nara, where they had worshipped for so
many years in Japan, seemed to be haunted. But this
mountain does not feel haunted, nor as yet does it feel
sacred. But so far we are only up three thousand feet,
with mosquitoes all alive about us, and scissor-grinders
shrilling their souls out in just, I should think, the
highest note possible for the human ear to hear, besides
others more like other scissor-grinders.</p>

<p>"Then, though this temple seemed clean on first
arrival by comparison with Chinese inns, its dirt now
has a very materialising effect upon one's susceptibilities.
It is beautifully situated on a spur of the
mountain, with an amphitheatre of mountain-peaks
girdling it in except on one side, where it looks
down on the lesser hills and rivers we came up
from. There are trees, and, we are assured, tigers,
a man having been eaten by one ten days ago. But
as I am also told eight men together were going up
a peak not far from here, and of the eight five were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
killed by tigers, I am
not quite sure whether
one can believe everything
one is told on
Omi-shan. At all
events, the tiger-mosquitoes
seem a
more real danger at
present. We had sixteen
nights in Chinese
inns to get here from
Chungking, travelling
always westward; so
I cannot think many Europeans will come, till there
are steamers running to Chungking, and Cook has
organised through-tickets. But the chief priest thinks
if he could only do these rooms up many foreigners
would come, and all give him many taels, and then
the temples could all be restored."</p>

<p class="p2">There are many wonders upon this sacred mountain,
one the so-called Glory of Buddha, which we saw every
afternoon during the fortnight in August we spent on
its summit. Another, more puzzling to me, we only
saw once. We were called out about nine o'clock on
a keen, frosty night to see the lamps of Kiating, the
city ten thousand feet below us, that had come up to be
lighted. Some rich donor has given the lamps of Kiating
particularly high lamp-posts to facilitate this miracle.
Certainly, on each out-jutting spur of the mountain, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
we looked down from the edge of the great precipice,
we saw a large luminous light apparently quite stationary,
and in effect recalling the lamps of Piccadilly at night.
Some people say this must be caused by electricity.
Certainly, on Mount Omi we always seemed to look
down upon the storms of thunder and lightning that
evening after evening cooled the hot country below
us. But the most beautiful sight was to turn away
from the grand views as far as the eye could reach over
the rivers and hills and cities of China, and, standing
on the verge of the precipice, look just in the other
direction, across the sea of mountains with serrated edges
or slanting-backs, two flat-topped table-mountains conspicuous
among them, till there at last up in the sky,
"as if stood upon a table for us to look at," as some
Chinaman said centuries ago, stood the long range of
the snowy giants of Tibet, with great glaciers clinging
to their sides, and catching the first rosy light of
morning, whilst all the other intervening mountains
were still wrapped in their blankets of mist and night.</p>

<p class="caption">GREAT PRECIPICE OF MOUNT OMI.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Many beautiful descriptions have been written of
Mount Omi, that mountain that stands alone in its
sacredness in the far west of China, with an all-round
view from its summit, where the beholder stands on the
verge of one of the most gigantic precipices in the world,
said by Mr. Baber to be a mile deep. But it would be
hard to surpass that of Fan Yü-tsz, of the Ming Dynasty,
who tells how he saw the Wa-wu, and the snowy mountains
"running athwart like a long city wall," and India,
and the mountains of Karakorum, together with all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
barbarous kingdoms, the great Min River, and the rivers
of Kiating, the Tung, and the Ya; and winds up by
saying: "The advocate and I clapped our palms, and
cried out, 'The grandest view of a lifetime!'" The
cloud effects from Fujiyama's top are different, but not
finer; and Fuji has no snowy mountains of Tibet to
look out upon. The all-round view from the ever
popular and most beloved Rigi seems a plaything sort
of pretty pigmy view by comparison.</p>

<p>And day after day, year after year, all the year
round, pilgrims come and prostrate themselves on the
different out-jutting bastions of the cliff upon boards
laid in the wet grass for their convenience while they
venerate Puhsien, who, they say, came up from India
on his elephant and settled here; just as their ancestors
probably came, before ever Buddha was, to venerate
the sun-god, as we call him now, we not apparently
having even yet learnt enough to say simply God,
as if there were, or could be, God this and God that,&mdash;not
one God, the Father of All&mdash;to use the simple
comprehensive Chinese phrase, "The Above All!"
The men and women of the province come in great
numbers: the men with their brows bound with the
white Szechuan handkerchief like Dante, and with
mouths like the old Greek gods, with rich, regular
curves; the women with their skirts only to their
knees, and feet of the natural size or only slightly deformed,
and in each case bound with Indian corn-husks,
the better to contend with the steep stone steps that lead
up and down the ten thousand feet of mountain-side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Men from Yunnan come too, with extraordinarily heavy
and knotted young trees for walking-sticks, shod, not
with iron points, but small iron spades, that they may
if need be re-make the road as they go along. Military
dandies even from far Ningpo are carried up the
mountain in sedan-chairs (this last a work of great
difficulty); whilst old men and very weak women manage
to get up in a sort of basket carried on a man's back,
their feet holding on round his waist after the fashion
that children are carried pick-a-back. And in the winter
the Tibetans come, men and women all together, all
in furs, and saying, "Om Mani Padmi Hum!" instead
of the familiar, "Omito Fo," the habitual greeting on
the mountain-side. Some of the wild tribes also come,
without pigtails, like decent people, but with their hair
strangely sticking out in front of their heads, as if they
wore their tails in front. And all prostrate themselves,
and do reverence&mdash;<i>unless</i> it be the few Europeans
who have strayed so far west through China&mdash;as they
look over the edge of the great precipice, and there on
the mist below see the circular halo of three primary
colours, very brilliant, and in its central brightness the
shadow of their own head and shoulders, or, if their
heart be such, Puhsien himself riding on his elephant,
as he came from India more than two thousand
years ago. Where the pilgrims most do congregate
some pious donor has had strong iron chains fastened
between iron supports; and in another place there is a
low stone wall: but so great is the indifference to its
depth that so lofty a precipice inspires,&mdash;we ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
once resided on a fifth story, and found many of our
visitors unable to look out, and ourselves suffered somewhat
from dizziness; but on moving to the eleventh
floor of the same building felt nothing of the kind,&mdash;so
great is the indifference to its danger that this great
precipice inspires, that not a day passes but people
are getting outside
the chains, or
standing on the
top of the low
wall, the better to
see down below.</p>

<p class="caption">PRIEST AND PILGRIMS ON EDGE OF OMI PRECIPICE.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>And there, as
we look down
upon the beautiful
trees far beneath
us, and the flowers
finding here and
there a foothold,
we become aware
of a cave, that
looks quite inaccessible
now, although
it may not always have been so; and below
the cave, just a little way farther down the precipice,
something&mdash;we cannot quite make out what.
We saw it from the first, and then turned away to
look at the city of Kiating, picturesquely situated at
the junction of its three rivers, or to notice how
swollen the rivers are with the recent heavy rains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
or to catch a distant glimpse of the one Taoist
monastery on the mountain, perched like an eyrie on
its most picturesque out-jutting spur, or, as so often,
to watch the mist roll up. Oftenest it comes flying
up from the hot lowlands at our feet; but at times it
crawls up like a great white bear, lifting first one paw,
then another, yet always securing its foothold even on
the sheerest edge of the precipice. At other times it
comes up like a sinuous serpent; and sometimes, enfolding
all the landscape, it flows over the precipice
from the top like a Niagara of mist. But always as
the mist lifts, and we lean over the precipice, scanning
closely, we see that cave, which surely no man could
ever reach, and, below, something curious lying aslant
on an edge of the cliff; yet never is our curiosity sufficiently
awakened to lift an opera-glass, and see what
it may be: it looks so small and insignificant&mdash;just
something out of place in the vast landscape, that is all.</p>

<p>Then we see other caves, and hear wild talk of
aborigines, who live, or lived, in them. The coolies
talk of nothing but aborigines and the unconquered
Lolos. One of them has been two years among
the latter as a soldier; and he tells how his general's
wife was taken prisoner by them, and put upon an
ox to ride, since she could not walk, and describes
them as a sort of Highlanders, wearing a skirt and
a wrap, and not rude at all to those they carry off&mdash;only
wanting to get ransom-money. Then we meet
a pilgrim, who is standing staring at some caves far
below with protruding eyes; and he says, "There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
are tigers in there!" then stands speechless. But on
our laughing we are told again of six men already
this year eaten by tigers. It is a comfort to laugh even
over tigers; for the high, rare air affects the nerves
even of our coolies, and every one is asking for
quinine as a cure for neuralgia. For foreign medicines
are known in the West, and "They never cost anything,"
as some women with a sick child said with great energy,
and confidence that we must be able to cure the child,
and for nothing, as missionaries or foreigners (here the
two words are treated as synonymous) always did.
Then, as one coolie after another sickened, and we
ourselves could hardly breathe or bear the aching of
our heads, we were told a very dangerous air came up
over the precipice, and how a Taoist priest, who was
going to live in a cave on the mountain, dropped down
dead of it. And none of our Chinese would hear of
a cave being possibly full of gas, or that the air on
the top of the mountain was so much lighter than that
below that a little time is needed to get accustomed
to it.</p>

<p>And whilst explaining scraps of modern science, we
forgot all about the Taoist priest who died, till one
day again we were hanging over the cliff, watching
for the Glory of Buddha below, when we noted a
Chinaman gazing down more intently than devoutly.
"Do you see him?" he asked. "I could not find him
this morning; and I would not believe what they all
said, that a Taoist priest lay there. But what else can
it be? Do you look through your far-seeing glass, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
say what you see." So we looked at that something
out of place, that had at once caught short-sighted eyes
intently scanning, yet without arresting our attention
sufficiently even to wonder what it might be. Yes!
certainly there lay, across a fallen tree, what looked
like a man with a hood on, like that the chief priest
here wore, with an old basket at his feet. "Yes, that's
it&mdash;that's it. All the Taoists wear that! With his
feet in a basket! That is how they say he lies. He
has lain there two years, they say; and last year his
clothes looked blue, and now they look whitey-brown.
Next year, I suppose, they will all fall to pieces. I suppose
it must be a man. I would not believe it at first."
"No, no; it is not a Taoist priest," said the young
Buddhist, whose duty it was to be agreeable to visitors.
"It is just some clothes people have thrown down."
But, in the first place, no human hand could throw
clothes so far. They must long before have, fluttering,
caught upon some rugged edge. Next, nothing thrown
could so exactly take the semblance of a man,&mdash;the hood
worn just as the chief priest wears his, only the head
fallen forward somewhat, and the lower part of the
person in dust-coloured clothes evidently fast approaching
decay, but even yet lingering on just where
they would be if a man lay there wearing them. The
idea of clothes thrown down certainly would not hold
water. The idea of a sort of Guy Fawkes figure did
at one time present itself; but whilst it seemed possible
that some enthusiast might attempt to climb to that
inaccessible cave, and so climbing fall and perish, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
did not seem possible that any one would be foolhardy
enough to climb there for the purpose merely of placing
a lay figure there, or could do so, carrying a lay figure.
Yet, not wishing to be too credulous, we approached
the chief priest the next time his picturesque figure
in grey silk gown and black hood appeared beside
the parapet, and propounded the theory of clothes.
His dark eyes grew luminous with a sad smile; his
is a face in which a painter would delight, with its
rich dark shades, well-marked features, and general
air of an Oriental saint of the early Christian era.
"Those are no clothes," he said, sadly smiling. "A
Taoist priest lies there."</p>

<p>And could there be a grander grave for a dead man,&mdash;the
great white mists of Omi his winding-sheet, the
Glory of Buddha floating above him his memorial cross,
the bosom of Omi's inaccessible precipice his last resting-place?
Year by year, day by day, pilgrims kneel, and
knock their foreheads on the ground, then hold out
hands of supplication over his prostrate form; the bells
are struck, the prayers are chanted, the incense burns,
above the unburied priest's last resting-place. Never
now will hand of man touch him more. He lies secure.
He sought to pass away from the contamination of
the world, and in pure ecstasy of devotion pass his
days in an untrodden cave. And it seems that God&mdash;our
God, his God, the Lord and Father of us all&mdash;accepted
the offering without requiring the year-long
daily sacrifice. There are no signs of struggle in the
orderly disposed garments. It seems as if his spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
passed away as his foot stumbled, and he fell across
the fallen tree.</p>

<p>And to make it grander still, he has won no
immortal name thereby. The young priest in the
temple on the summit says, "That is no unburied
saint lies there&mdash;only clothes!" He takes us to
a neighbouring shrine of his own faith to see a
real unburied saint. As we ascended the mountain,
we were struck by an image upon an altar from its
likeness to a man in its little human imperfections, all
covered with gilding though it was, as well as decked
out in somewhat tawdry bright embroidered satins.
We only noticed, and passed on, repelled by a large
and really rather offensively ugly representation of
Puhsien standing behind it. The front figure was
seated on a large lotus flower, with its legs tucked up
underneath it, just as the chief priest at our temple
tucked up his legs when he sat to have his photograph
taken, putting on his best vestments for the purpose,
and looking no longer like an early Christian, without
his hood, and with his bald shining head. "There!
that was a priest here in the time of Kang Hsi," said
the young priest. "It is his very body, not embalmed.
It would not decay, and so he was&mdash;&mdash;" Now, did he
say <i>canonised</i>? "Few foreigners know of this&mdash;&mdash;"
Now, did he say God or saint? So much turns
upon a word sometimes, and so few foreigners know
Chinese well enough to be clear about these delicate
distinctions.</p>

<p>A set of dandies in rich-coloured silks from Kiating,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
with yellow incense-bags and double purses, invaded
the temple, not for the purpose of staring, as we were
doing, but to worship. They prostrated themselves,
burnt their joss-sticks, and struck the gong before the
gilded old man upon the altar just in the same way
that they did before the other images. And they looked
so picturesque doing this, it seemed a pity to wait to
set up the camera till they had gone, and then only to
photograph the gilded old man upon the altar and the
priest of seventy-one of to-day who ministers before
it. The living old man was quite excited by the
proceeding, and completely unaware that photography
demanded the posture, generally most congenial to a
Chinaman, of repose.</p>

<p>Even through all his gilding, the face of the other
old man upon the altar gave an idea of holiness, and
this in spite of his having as typically slanting eyes
as any Chinaman living. Some of his teeth were gone,
and his mouth had a little helpless sort of crookedness
about it that was very touching. It seemed impossible
then and there to hear anything of his history; but it
seemed equally impossible, looking at him, to doubt that
he had been a good man, a Vicar of Wakefield simple
sort of good man, and probably deserved as well to
have his body set upon an altar and worshipped as any
mere man might. But the place of sepulture of the
unburied Taoist priest strikes the imagination as far
finer, recalling the grand lines upon the burial of Moses.
Angels bore Moses to his sepulchre, we are told. No
one has borne the Taoist priest. Even the winds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
of heaven cannot touch him, as he lies sheltered by
the great precipice on which he perished.</p>

<p>Thus, at but a little distance from each other, on the
summit of the sacred mountain of Omi, in this land
where more importance is attached to burial than in
any other, two Chinamen await unburied the consummation
of all things,&mdash;the one a disciple of Buddha; the
other, of that even less known Laotze, Buddha's
Chinese contemporary: the one covered over with gilding,
raised upon an altar, and certainly apparently
worshipped as a god; the other lying prone upon the
mountain-side, his poor perishable garments growing
threadbare in the snow and rain. But when the mists
gather round the mountain-top, and the sun shines
slanting from the west, it is above the ardent disciple
of Laotze that the Glory of Buddha floats&mdash;the man
who sought the grimmest possible retreat from the
snares of this world, and, thus seeking, found, we trust,
the joys of Paradise.

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<i>CHINESE SENTIMENT.</i></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In Memory of a Dead Wife.&mdash;Of a Dear Friend.&mdash;Farewell
Verses.&mdash;Æsthetic Feeling.&mdash;Drinking
Song.&mdash;Music.&mdash;Justice to Rats.
</p>
</div>

<p>It is so much our habit in China to think the Chinese
have no sentiment, that I have thought it might be
interesting to gather together what indications I have
observed during eleven years' residence among them,
leaving the reader, if of a judicial frame of mind, to sum
up and formulate his own conclusions.</p>

<p>One of the most poetic events in history used to
seem to me in childhood that crowning of his dead
Queen by King Pedro, to which Mrs. Hemans consecrated
some of her most pathetic verses. To this day
I cannot think of the beautiful dead Inez de Castro in
all the grandeur of her coronation robes, seated upon her
throne, without feeling something of the faint, cold
shuddering which the poetess imagines. Yet when I
went for the first time to a grand Chinese house in
the Arsenal at Shanghai, and found it all dressed out
with signs of mourning, white cloths, and balls of
twisted white cotton, people all in their best dresses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
and preparations
complete for three
days of theatrical
performance, though
I was startled to find
that all this was to
commemorate the
birthday of the wife
of the master of the
house, lying quiet in
her grave already
these twenty years,
the twenty-years-in-China-and-not-know-a-word-of-the-language
men all said
it was quite usual,
and seemed surprised
and annoyed that I
should find it affecting.
Alas! to this
day I have never
learned whether he
loved her very much,
nor quite satisfied
myself whether it
was really her birthday
or the day of her
death they were thus
celebrating. But, interpret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
it all after whatever fashion, there was surely
in this some indication of sentiment.</p>

<p>Again, there are many suicides in China, and habit
seems to make both Europeans and Chinese callous.
Yet when a German who had returned to China happy
in the belief a girl he knew would follow and marry
him, and on hearing she had changed her mind, or for
some other reason would not come, thought it better
to leave a life that for him held no promise, the
following poem appeared in a Shanghai paper:</p>

<p>The Englishman who could write as good a poem
in Chinese has not yet been born; but I quote it
because of the sentiment it expresses.

<p>The young Chinese to whom I tried to teach
English took leave of me, when I left for England,
in very elegant Chinese verse, to which I wish
I could do justice by translation. The sentiment
of it was very appropriate. He regretted
my departure, wondering what he should do
without me; for to him I had been like
the snow, which, by covering up and protecting
the plants, makes the young shoots
grow, as I had made his intelligence
burgeon. This struck me as a very
happy expression of sentiment, and, as
I was assured by Chinese scholars, equally felicitously
expressed.</p>

<p class="caption">ROOF AND ROOF-END AT CHUNGKING.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Chinese love of beautiful curves, spending time
and money on the roof-cornices and outside ornaments
of even quite a poor cottage, indicates a deep-seated
sentiment for the beautiful, as do also the trees in their
towns, some of which have almost as many trees as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
houses, as also their love of flowers. In the flowering
season a bough of blossom may be seen in a vase on
the counter of even the darkest little shop; whilst no
literary man would think his writing-table complete
without a vase for one lovely blossom, and no woman
would think herself dressed until she had stuck a flower
on one side of her glossy hair. But every one probably
would acknowledge that the Chinese have a very strong
æsthetic sentiment. Here, however, is an adieu to the
Old Year much resembling one of Burns' songs in
its sentiment, or want of it:</p>

<p class="center">"ADIEU TO THE OLD YEAR.</p>

<p>But this Chinese drinking-song, which could without
exciting any special comment appear upon a New
Year's card of to-day, was published in the Chinese
Book of Odes 500 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> Twelve centuries later we
find a decidedly prettier sentiment and finer touch in
Li-tao-po, one of China's favourite poets <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 720. It
is interesting to notice that four of China's poets, Tze-ma-hsiang-yu,
Yang-hsiung, Li-tao-po, and <i>Su-tung-po</i>,
were all born and spent their earliest years in Szechuan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
on the borderland of Tibet, and the yet unconquered
Lolo country, like our own English Border country,
China's cradle of legend and song.</p>

<p>This is an attempt to render the best-known ode of
China's favourite bard, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 720:</p>

<p class="center">"ON DRINKING ALONE BY MOONLIGHT.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza"><p>Here are flowers, and here is wine;</p>
<p>But where's a friend with me to join</p>
<p>Hand to hand and heart to heart</p>
<p>In one full cup before we part?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Rather than to drink alone,</p>
<p>I'll make bold to ask the moon</p>
<p>To condescend to lend her face</p>
<p>To grace the hour and the place.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Lo! she answers, and she brings</p>
<p>My shadow on her silver wings;</p>
<p>That makes three, and we shall be,</p>
<p>I ween, a merry company.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The modest moon declines the cup,</p>
<p>But shadow promptly takes it up;</p>
<p>And when I dance, my shadow fleet</p>
<p>Keeps measure with my flying feet.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Yet though the moon declines to tipple,</p>
<p>She dances in yon shining ripple;</p>
<p>And when I sing, my festive song</p>
<p>The echoes of the moon prolong.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Say, when shall we next meet together?</p>
<p>Surely not in cloudy weather;</p>
<p>For you, my boon companions dear,</p>
<p>Come only when the sky is clear."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6"><i>Translated by W. A. P. M.</i></p>
</div></div></div>
<p>The fancy if not the sentiment of this song is so
pretty, that it is hard to see how the nation that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
produced it can be rebuked for want of sentiment by the
nation that to this day sings, "Drink, puppies, drink."
Indeed, I think this Chinese drinking-song dating
from the eighth century <span class="s08">A.D.</span> the very prettiest I have
ever met with in any literature. It has three if not
four of such graceful conceits as would alone make the
success of a modern bard. But they are old, very old.
And China, too, is old; and is said to produce nothing
of the kind now.</p>

<p>To turn to comparatively more modern days, <i>Lu-pe-Ya's
Lute</i>, Englished and reduced into poetry by
Mrs. Augusta Webster, shows a sentiment for friendship
and for music deep in the Chinese breast. It is, I
suppose, because I am so very unmusical that I rather
enjoy Chinese music. It seems to me very merry,
especially its funereal chants.</p>

<p>People often wonder if the Chinese enjoy European
music. Two Englishmen were invited not long ago
to a military mandarin's house to hear one of his sons,
a great musician, play. The latter could only perform
if perfect silence were observed by the audience and
a vase of flowers and lighted incense before him to
help his inspiration. Unfortunately, after all these
preparations, it appeared his was a stringed instrument,
to be laid upon the table and played with the
nails&mdash;the most difficult instrument to play upon that
the Chinese possess; and the melody, if it were a
melody, was so low, the Englishmen came away quite
unable to judge of its beauty. "Heard melodies are
sweet, but those unheard&mdash;&mdash;" However, some other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
young military mandarins had played a duet on flutes,
and another performed on a flageolet, both very
agreeably.</p>

<p>It may interest those interested&mdash;and who of us
in China are not?&mdash;in the great opium question to
hear that a young lad of sixteen went away from the
dinner-table to smoke opium. "How dreadful!" said
one of the Europeans. "A lad of sixteen to smoke
opium! He will never live!" "Why, look at my five
sons, all born since I smoked," said the host; "I began
when I was twenty. But, indeed, his family are rather
glad he smokes. You see, my guest is a very rich young
fellow from up the river, who has no father; and if he
did not smoke opium, he would be sure to be getting
into mischief with women or gambling. Now, smoking
opium, they think, will keep him at home." Is not this
rather a novel view of the question?</p>

<p>The old legend of the Fairy Foxes, which I
Englished some years ago, and brought out in
Mr. Hasegawa's very pretty <i>crêpe</i> paper series, shows
a sentiment of kindness for animals with which some
people are unwilling to credit a nation that emphatically
does not say, "What a beautiful day! Let us go
out and kill something." Both that and <i>The Rat's
Plaint</i>, translated from the original Chinese and
rendered into verse by my husband, and very beautifully
illustrated as well as reproduced on <i>crêpe</i> paper by
Mr. Hasegawa, might be circulated by the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The latter's
quaintness&mdash;it is a very old Chinese legend&mdash;alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
makes the reader pass over the very nice sentiment
for poor pussy, as well as the homely Chinese sense
of justice, stating the rat's case in the first instance
so very plainly as almost to make the reader incline
to his side.</p>

<p>There is an easy-going live-and-let-live character
about the Chinese, which makes them very pleasant
employers, as all steamship captains will testify, and
which, perhaps, accounts for their not hurrying off
the face of the earth the rats that are such a great
pest in a Chinese city. An English Consul, on undoing
a not yet used camera, found that to get at the gum
used they had eaten through each fold of its dark
chamber. One year in Chungking they made a hole
through a strong wooden case we thought safely closed
down, opened the tins of milk just as we should have
done ourselves, and evidently dipped their tails in,
and fished out all the milk those tails could reach.
We have often thought this worthy to be a <i>Spectator</i>
story. But, however incredible it may sound, it is true;
and when we opened the case, we found all the top
layer out of two dozen tins of milk opened and half
emptied in this way. Worse still, that same year&mdash;there
was famine in the land, and human beings were
dropping down dead of hunger every day by the
river-side&mdash;there was a hole one morning in our
dear little pony's back, said to be caused by the
wicked rats.</p>

<p>The Chinese easy-going liberal disposition and
sense of justice have been immortalised in <i>The Rat's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
Plaint</i>, translated by my husband, where the poor rat's
case is made out as I never saw it till I read it there;
though in the end the rat is awarded punishment, and
pussy-cat installed in her high place as favoured friend
in every homestead. And so herewith an end of
Chinese sentiment.</p>

<p>There are many summer trips that are a joy
in the remembering, but a trip to Chinese Tibet
had never fallen to the lot of any European woman
before. And it was the more delightful, perhaps, because
we never thought of anything of the kind when we
started. But there is a drawback to living on a mountain-summit
that it is such a climb to come back again
when you go out; and our quarters on Mount Omi were
not too comfortable! Only one small room for living
and sleeping in, like a back room in a Canadian log-hut,
and without a window to open, makes one restless
after a time. So we thought we would gently stroll
on to another sacred mountain, whose flat top was a
very striking feature in the landscape. And we went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
down into what is called the Wilderness, where there
are wild cattle and wild men, and for about a week
wandered on, passing along by the boundary of the
unconquered Lolos, and up the most magnificent ravine
I have seen or can imagine, down which a torrent
had swept but a week before from the Sai King, or
Drying Prayerbooks Mountain, to which we were bound,
drowning twenty-six people in one hamlet alone.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0414" id="i_0414"></a>
<img src="images/i_0414.jpg" width="550" height="493" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SACRED SAI KING MOUNTAIN.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Climbing the Sai King was rather a formidable affair.
But for the guidance of a young priest, returning from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
one of those begging excursions by means of which
he had bought the whole mountain-summit, we never
should have reached the top before darkness set in;
and in the dark no man would dare to move upon
the Sai King. For not only are there all manner of
wild beasts, but the path leads along the narrow edge
of a <i>col</i>, and then up staircases, till at last you arrive
at three ladders, one of twenty-seven rungs, before
you find yourself at the top of the awful precipices
that girdle it all round, in a sort of park with firs and
rhododendrons, the latter at least twenty feet high, moss
hanging from them in garlands, as well as a foot deep
upon the ground. It is a veritable boys' paradise (and
as such I have described it at length in the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i> of January, 1896), with squirrels and deer and
birds innumerable, large very sweet white strawberries
in the greatest profusion, raspberries abundant, currants
plentiful, mushrooms in bushels. There are glorious
views from the brink of precipices, when you can break
your way through the rhododendrons and look over,
hearing the rivers murmuring some five or six thousand
feet below, and seeing the Tibetan summits like a sea
of mountains.</p>

<p>But I have mentioned nearly all there was to eat
on the Sai King Shan, and our room was almost more
cracks than room, so that we shivered inside it even
when almost blinded by wood smoke. And when the
wind howled and the rain poured in like a waterspout,
it did occur to us to wonder what we should do if
one of the ladders were carried away. Besides, by dint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
of thinking about it, the going down those ladders
became increasingly terrible. I had paused in the
middle of coming up, and, looking between my feet,
had seen the mists moving and the cataract falling four
thousand feet sheer below me, and through a rift in
the clouds had caught a sight of the great precipice
to the north, greater even than that on Omi. We
found ourselves wondering whether it would be wise
to look down and gaze on everything, if clear, when
descending. When we had got as far as that, it seemed
more prudent to go down at once. And it was then
we saw from the bottom the great north precipice,
that is the most glorious east end of a world's cathedral.
Looked at from where one will, one could not but feel in
comparison how poor was a temple made with hands.
Yet there in the valley six thousand feet below was the
chapel and priests' house, built by their own hands
with their own money by the people of the wholly
Christian village of Tatientze. And here, close
to the summit of the mountain, where a cord used
to hang over the precipice to get down by, was the
cave where two Buddhist sisters, till last year, lived
seven years "to purify their souls." There was a
little platform in front of the cave where they could
stand and look out upon the glories of the Creator's
handiwork, if so minded. Did they stand there, those
two sisters? Did they worship there? Did they in
the end purify their souls? Or did they find it was a
mistake, thus retiring from their kind? Their father
used to send them rice, which was let down to them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
by the cord, and a stream poured over the precipice
in a sort of waterfall hard by. And they only went
away the year before because the tidings had come of
their mother's death.</p>

<p>Again we wandered on, or rather walked hard, for
one day across the mountains, till we came to a village
full of conquered Lolos, women fearless and frank as
American girls, riding and walking with a grace I have
never seen equalled; their men with elaborate ceremonial
of politeness, but, alas! too much given to the delights
of drink. We would gladly have learned more about
them. But now we heard six days more would bring us
to Tachienlu, in Chinese Tibet, and all our following
were wild to get there, and to get fur coats, the
Chinaman's ambition. As for ourselves, we wondered if
it were worth while to go on, but we were certainly in
no hurry as yet to get back to Chungking. Our last
news from there was that it was 100° in the shade, and
cholera worse than ever. Thirty thousand people, we
learnt afterwards, died of it in the course of the
summer, and it was worse still at Chengtu, the capital
of the province, by which we had purposed returning.</p>

<p>Not at all particularly anxious for fur coats, not at
all distinctly remembering what we had read of Tachienlu,
we decided to go on if we could get ponies,
and thus decide for ourselves if it were worth while.
But now came the difficulty. With ponies grazing all
round, we never could succeed in hiring one. Certainly
they were very small, and we very big by comparison.
Every one told us we must get ponies at Fulin. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
to Fulin we pushed on. But this was thirty-six miles,
over any number of passes, one seven thousand feet
high, so we were obliged to stop a little short of it
that night. Next day, however, we got there for
breakfast. We had formed high expectations with
regard to Fulin. For six days we had seen men
staggering along under crushing weights of salt, two
hundred pounds to each man, too much exhausted by
their burdens even to look up. And they had all been
bound for Fulin. People may not want to be missionaries
in China, but I do not think any European could
travel there and not wish to undo the heavy burdens,
and I have seen no beasts of burthen whose sufferings
have so moved my heart to pity as these salt-carriers.
Salt is such a hard, uncompromising load, and it was
so pitiful to notice how they had to protect it from
being melted by the sweat that streamed down their
poor backs. Then the passes were so high, and the
paths so narrow and so wild, and the heat so great.
It seemed as if any human heart must break, if it
contemplated beforehand all it would have to undergo
to carry one load of salt from Kiating to Fulin. Then,
however often we calculated it, what they were paid,
how many days they spent upon the journey, how
many days going empty-handed back, we never could
make out that the poor carriers were any the better
off at the end of all their exertions. Of course they
must be, or they would not make them; but it must
be by a miserable pittance indeed. It appeared now,
too, that Fulin, though well-to-do enough, was but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
distributing centre for two very rich prosperous valleys
and the country beyond, and there were no ponies to
be had there. Later on in the day, however, when
we really did succeed in hiring capital ponies, we no
longer wondered that it had been difficult to get any for
such a journey as we were undertaking. For what
road there had ever been had been carried away in
several places, and so had the bridges. The mountains
looked exactly as if, according to the Chinese saying,
a dragon had really turned round at the top, and clawed
and scored and gashed the mountain-sides. All the
people were going to market, as they always are in
Szechuan, and in one place was a crowd busy remaking
a bridge in order to get over, whilst farther on three
of the strongest men of the company had stripped, and,
holding hands, were cautiously trying fording. Then
the others followed their example, and for a moment
or two were carried off their legs by the furious stream.
The hills were terrible, and, clambering up one, a mule
in our company failed to establish its footing, and,
turning over and over, reached the bottom dead. Just
the moment before I had been wondering whether my
tiny pony could make the final effort necessary to attain
the top of that hill.</p>

BRICK-TEA ROAD.<br />

<p>After Nitou, which proclaims on a stone tablet that
it is the western boundary of the black-haired or
Chinese race, Tibet seems to begin. We climbed a
pass nine thousand feet high, then descended again
for five miles, always in uninhabited country, full of
flowers. Especially lovely in that September weather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
was the small but very luxuriant deep purple convolvulus
twining round the acacia mimosas. Just as we passed
out of the mist&mdash;it was unfortunately always misty at
the tops of the passes&mdash;we met a Lama quite resplendent
in crimson and old gold,
and then passed troops
of men carrying brick
tea. One man carried
seventeen bars, each
weighing twenty
pounds; others fifteen,
thirteen, or eleven.
A boy of fourteen, of
ten, even one of seven,
was carrying, the latter
four half-bars, poor wee
child! Just as we were
sorrowing over the
children, trees glorious
with coral flowers
flashed upon our sight.
And on the second day
after leaving Nitou we
once more came upon
the great Tung river,
by the side of which we had before travelled for one
whole afternoon, separated only by it from the unconquered
Lolo country. Never a boat nor raft upon
the Tung, except one to take people back into Lololand
from a great theatrical performance, at which all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
the countryside had mustered. And once we saw
a boat by the side of it, but hauled up high and dry.
It was a round skin-boat, for all the world just like
the coracles the ancient Britons used. We came also
upon a terrible gully, descending by a severe slant
directly into the river. A shower of stones was almost
continuously rattling down, mixed with a little water;
every now and then the shower slackened somewhat,
and then first one and then another large stone would
come down, wildly bounding from side to side; after
that, the shower would be stronger than ever. When
the erratic blocks came bounding down, no one put
his feet in the footprints left by some one else across
the shifting torrent of stones, that here constituted the
whole of the great brick-tea road, the great main road
between Peking and Lassa. At other times they paused
behind a projecting rock, to watch for a good opportunity,
and then ran for it. And the usual thing seemed to
be to laugh. Our little dog had its misgivings in the
middle, and paused, to be half kicked, half thrown across.
For it was an anxious moment for our carrying coolies
and the heavily laden brick-tea men. Meanwhile, our
cook amused himself by pitching stones into the air,
and it was eerie to observe that, wherever thrown, and
however often they bounded, they all ended by falling
into the deep, swift waters of the unnavigable Tung.</p>

<p>The next wonder was the celebrated bridge, three
hundred feet long, and with hardly any drop in the
nine iron chains of which it is composed. Planks were
laid loosely upon the chains, starting up at each of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
the ponies' steps, and the whole bridge swayed like
a ship at sea. Two guardians of the bridge at once
rushed forward, and placed their arms under mine to
support me across, taking for granted that I should
be frightened. But looked upon as a yacht pitching
and tossing, the bridge really did not make bad weather
of it, so I preferred to walk alone and to notice how
sea-sick our coolies looked. Just at that point the
Tung vividly recalled the Rhine at Basle, but with
probably a greater volume of water. That afternoon
the scenery began to be as wild and gloomy as we
had anticipated, granite mountains increasing in size
and narrowing in upon us, the road taking sudden
drops down precipitous gorges of four or five hundred
feet, and then at once up again. There were prickly
pears all about, and pomegranate-trees in hedges, the
air full of thyme and peppermint and aromatic scents.
Tibetan villages, just like the pictures, were visible
on the far left bank of the Tung,&mdash;two-storied houses,
with tiny holes for windows, and door uncomfortably
high up, so that no one could get in, if once the entrance
ladder were drawn up; roofs set so as apparently to
let in a free current of air. Not a tree visible, not a
man moving: there never is in the pictures! Impossible,
however, to get across the Tung to look at them; and
when isolated houses were visible on our side, it was
always in inaccessible eyries.</p>

<p>The little pony I rode, not one of those excellent
ponies we hired the first day for a few hours only, had
come down twice on both knees with me on its back.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
It was evident its little legs might have been stronger.
And as I rode along these granite precipices, my hands
were hot with terror, until at last I could bear no more.
For some time beforehand I had been looking at the
road in front, curving round two headlands&mdash;granite
precipice above, granite precipice below&mdash;the road
overarched by the rock, and had wondered how all
our party would get by. "We met one hundred and
fifty people coming from that direction before our
luncheon," I said to myself. "I know it because I
counted them. And if anything, I left out some, when
the road was too alarming. They must all have got
by alive! And all these brick-tea men now coming
along with us, of course they are all intending to get
by alive. It can't be so bad!" But it was of no use!
I could not ride along that road, with the pony slipping
and stumbling among the stones, and sliding down
the little descents at the corners with both its hind
feet together. Yet the road was good for those parts,
being all of granite and painfully chiselled out; so the
pony-boy, a most lively youth of fifteen, was greatly
shocked at my dismounting.</p>

<p>We slept that night where the Lu joins the Tung,
cutting a granite mountain in half to do so, the half
that is left standing towering some three or four
thousand feet above our heads. The Lu is the fullest
glacier stream I have ever seen. It has a great deal
more water to carry than the Thames at Richmond,
and sometimes it is compressed into a width of six
yards, with a tremendous fall, coming straight, we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
told, from a lake at the foot of the great glacier we
saw first with such delight from the summit of sacred
Omi, about a hundred miles away as the crow flies.
All day we rode or walked up the defile, that would
have been too solemn but for this rollicking glacier
stream tumbling head over heels all the way down it,
with side cataracts leaping down, equally overfull of
foaming water, equally in hot haste to reach the Tung.
The road was all the way so bad that at last my only
surprise was to find that there were places the ponies
could not manage, and that on one occasion they had,
twice in five minutes, to ford a stream with the water
well up to my feet, as they stumbled among the big
boulders in order to avoid a bit of road that all the
heavily laden brick-tea men had managed. It seemed
too absurd that those ponies could not, they had done
so much already. But at last the pony-boy waved
his arm, as if to say, "There's Tachienlu! I've got
you there at last! You can't get into trouble now, I
think, along what we call the bit of smooth road in
front. And I wash my hands of you!"</p>

<p>We rode on, past our last Tibetan bridge. How
often they had haunted my childhood's dreams! And
now I saw a woman seat herself astride the stick
hanging from the cord drawn taut across the stream,
and, resting one arm upon a very smooth piece of
bamboo that runs along the cord, hold with the other
hand a series of loops of cords hanging from it, and
allow herself to be pulled across. I longed to do likewise,
and went the length of seating myself on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
stick; but the foaming torrent below meant certain death
if one could not hold on, nor did I know at all what
reception the Tibetan men on the other side might
give me, so I got off again. People say it is easy
enough to go as far as the slope of the cord is downwards,
but very hard to pull oneself up the other side,
and that just at the centre the impulse to let go
is almost overmastering. We passed flagstaffs with
lettered pieces of cloth hanging from them inscribed
with prayers, passed rocks with prayers chiselled on
their smooth surfaces, into the little frontier town at
the junction of three valleys, with granite mountains
hemming it in all round, one terminating in a sharp
little granite pyramid, quite a feature in the view, and
in what looked exactly like a fortress with three big
cannon pointed in different directions.</p>

<p>We had already met one most exciting party of
Tibetans, the men fine-looking, one even more than
that, the women rosy and pleasant-faced and very short-skirted,
but evidently all thinking it an excellent joke
not to let me look at them, and such fleet mountaineers
that, though I ran, I could not keep up with them,
and they were all out of sight, merrily laughing, before
we had half seen them. But now at Tachienlu far
more wonderful people became visible. It was as if
every wild tribe on the borders of China were represented,
and a piece of the garment of each patched
into the garment of every other. And in and out
among them strode the Lamas, right arm and shoulder
bared, like Roman senators in dull-red togas, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
arms folded and their attitude defiant. A beggar
passed singing, with a face like Irving's, only glorified.
He had bare feet, but his face was sublime. Then
strode by what looked like a tall Highlander, with a
striped garment of many colours draped round him,
boots of soft woollen coming to the knee, and edged
with a coarse stuff of brilliant red and yellow. Next,
two wild-looking men, with blue hats, that were hats
and hoods all in one, slouched upon their heads, a red
disc in the centre of each, their most luxuriant hair, in
innumerable very fine plaits, twisted round and round,
and fastened at one side with large red and yellow rings.
Tibetan women, with fine, rather Irish features, black
eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, were smiling on us
from the doorsteps, their hair plaited with a red cord,
and twisted in a most becoming coronal round their
heads. They had large silver earrings with red coral
drops, red cloth collars fastened by large silver clasps,
always a lump of coral in the centre of the middle
one, and a large turquoise in that on either side.
They had silver châtelaines hanging from their waists,
though often only a needlebook on the châtelaine, large
silver bracelets and strings of coral beads on their arms,
and their fingers covered with enormous rings.</p>

<p>Every one looked at us and smiled. Could anything
be more different from the reception we were accustomed
to in a Chinese city? Every one looked at us as if
to say, "Are not you glad to have got here?" We
felt more and more glad every minute, but a little
bewildered too. It was all so strange; the streets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
were so full of corners and of strange-looking people,
all looking and smiling at us. And they seemed to go
on for ever. When were we going really to arrive?</p>

<p class="caption">CARAVANSERAI AT TACHIENLU.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>But when we reached the caravanserai, or inn, where
Baber stayed and Mr. Rockhill and all the foreigners,
where Prince Henry
of Orleans and Mr.
Pratt were shut up
as it were, the
place looked so
forbidding we hesitated
to enter, till
reassured by hearing
the strident
tones of our Chinese
butler inside. The
rooms actually upstairs&mdash;after
we had
gone up the staircase,
embedded in
filth and hair&mdash;were
a most agreeable
surprise, almost as
good as an attic in
a London East-End lodging-house at first sight. Buttered
tea was served at once, and before many
minutes were over the lady of the inn, a very
handsome Tibetan, had invited me to a little repast
in her private room: tea buttered, of course&mdash;and
really very good&mdash;Tibetan cheese like very fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
cream-cheese, and <i>tsamba</i>, a kind of barley-meal, and
excellent when kneaded into a ball with buttered
tea. Lamas strode in and out of the courtyard, and
stared, swinging praying-wheels. All manner of men
and women looked in. It was quite enough to sit at
the window and look down at the kaleidoscope below,
for every one came in and gave us a glance. And
that was just what we wanted to do to them. But
they would not sell their praying-wheels, and the Lamas
would not let me look at the amulets which they carry
on their breasts in square cases, sometimes crusted
with turquoises. Surely never was there a people
more bejewelled. The dirtiest man we saw would have
a jewel or two stuck in his hair, and as likely as not
a huge ring on his finger.</p>

<p>There were five flagstaffs hung with prayers on
our inn, besides a long cord, hung with them, stretched
across the roof. People were muttering "Om Mani Padmi
Hum" as they passed along the street; and as the last
sound at night was the Lamas' trumpets calling to
prayers, so we were roused before dawn by the men
in the room below us reciting continuously "Om Mani
Padmi Hum" over and over again for two hours at
least. One began to say it oneself: "The jewel is
in the lotus,"&mdash;a pretty saying enough, which might
mean anything. But, alas! we could see no more of
the Tibetans at their devotions. At the first <i>lamaserai</i>
we visited the temple doors were closed, and the Lamas
signified by gestures that no key could be found to
open them. They were not uncivil there, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
rather peremptorily forbidding me to use my eyeglass
till they had themselves examined it, to see what effect
it might have on the brilliantly coloured pictures in the
temple porch. They also forbade me to photograph,
yet allowed me to do so in the end, and acquiesced
in my going upstairs to get a better place for the
camera. There I saw that the door of each Lama's
room, giving on the colonnade running round the courtyard,
was locked and padlocked with a padlock of
such portentous size as to suggest many thoughts.
Only one door downstairs had been open, where a
very small Lama was repeating his lessons out of what
looked like a most beautifully written and illuminated
book; for, the paper in the window being torn
out, we could see all over the room, which looked
like a particularly dirty, dilapidated little stable. But
when I asked the small boy's leave to go in, wishing
to examine his book, he sprang to the doorway, and
the attitude into which he threw himself, forbidding
me to enter, was superb. It said "Avaunt, Satanas!"
and indicated that all the lightnings of heaven would
fall, if I took but one step forward. And, though
amused, I could not but admire the little boy for so
pluckily standing his ground. But when another little
Lama, on our coolies somewhat roughly ordering him
to keep clear of the camera, threw himself into an
attitude of boxing, it seemed so ridiculous that, just
to test him, I laughed, then clenched my fist, and made
as if I would fight too; on which he laughed heartily,
showing he could quite understand a joke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the buildings at Tachienlu appeared in
the last stage of decay, especially the temples. One
was so full of birds' droppings that we imagined they
could never have been cleared away since the day it
was built. Two fierce dogs were chained across the
threshold; and though I found I could just squeeze
myself in out of reach of either, I noticed none of
our Chinese coolies cared to follow. Tibetan dogs are
noted for their fierceness, and are one of the great
difficulties of travel in Tibet. There were boys burning
something that had a horrible smell in the great incense-burner
in front, while a priest, attended by a boy, was
beating a gong and chanting within. This was the
only sign of worship we came across. But the passageway
between the back and front temple was all hung
with oblong bits of paper, on which prayers were
written. One day we met two very wild-looking
Tibetans, each bent under a load of three huge pieces
of slate inscribed with prayers; and presently we met
a string of Tibetan women, bent more than double
under loads of five, six, or even as many as seven bars
of brick tea, each weighing twenty pounds. The world
often seems rather topsy-turvy to a traveller.</p>

<p>A dark door like a house door, a dark passage
merely partitioned off from a shop, then an alley-way
that seemed to be used as a slaughter-house, led up
to Kwanyin's temple, a very conspicuous and rather
coquettish building on a hill overlooking the town.
When we got there, followed by a crowd of the usual
tiresome little Chinese boys, and also by two most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
beautiful Tibetans, on pushing open the door we found
numbers of neglected prayers hanging from the rafters,
old broken beams lying in a heap, a staircase so rickety
that no one liked to go up it, and, at the top of it, a
barred door, sufficiently saying "Not at home." One
of the Tibetans had such a quantity of hair, and such
ringlets, that one of our coolies, with Chinese insolence,
touched it to see if it was real. The Tibetan was
elderly, and evidently well seasoned to the world, and
only laughed at the liberty. But his companion&mdash;a
beautiful youth, with a face of that feminine type that
one only sees now in old books of beauty, arched
eyebrows delicately pencilled, aquiline nose, features
all too delicate for this workaday world&mdash;blushed vividly,
and looked so unutterably pained that I longed to
apologise, only we lacked a mutual language. He
had himself a yet more inordinate quantity of hair,
some of which must have been horse-hair, frizzed and
raised so as to simulate the high pompadour style;
but I think the ringlets that shadowed his translucent
complexion must have been his own.</p>

<p>Then we went on to the great <i>lamaserai</i>, some
distance from the town upon the Lassa road. We
walked between walls of prayer-slates on either hand,
with prayers streaming to the wind on all the hilltops
and on every point of vantage; and having crossed
the Chinese parade-ground, with a very beautiful weeping-willow
and an avenue of specially fine alders of a
local variety, saw a temple all golden points and golden
balls outside, and attached to it a long melancholy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
building rather like a workhouse, but for tall, narrow
baskets in all the windows ablaze with Tibetan Glory&mdash;a
brilliant orange marigold. Several little boy Lamas sat
on the doorstep playing with a dead rat, which they were
pulling about by a string, one little crimson-clad boy
screaming with delight at the dead creature's antics. We
had just been warned to take up our little dog because of
the fierce dogs inside, and the little Lamas now laughed
and cried out at the sight of a dog being carried.</p>

<p>There were many coloured cylinders on each side
of the entrance gate&mdash;prayer-wheels&mdash;and it was curious
to notice the expression of one of these children, when,
thinking I was imitating him, I turned one of the
cylinders the wrong way. He shrieked, and the expression
of concentrated rage in his knotted eyebrows
was a revelation to me. I hastened to turn the cylinder
the right way with a smile, and the little fellow was
pacified, while all the children set off running&mdash;as it
appeared afterwards&mdash;to announce our coming, and
have their own fierce dogs shut up.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in a very large courtyard&mdash;a
long parallelogram&mdash;handsomely, indeed gorgeously,
painted. Opposite to the entrance gate were the closed
doors of the temple, with no way of opening them
visible, brilliantly coloured pictures on either side of
them. The summits of the temple were so heavily
gilded as to look like solid gold, so also were two
deer about the size of collie dogs, sitting one on each
side of a large golden disc, curiously worked, placed
on the temple front above the door. On the top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
the temple were several of those curious Tibetan
ornaments of which I neither know the name nor the
purpose. Two looked like very tall, narrow, golden
flower-pots, handsomely ornamented; two like sticks
with ropes hanging down all round them, girt transversely
with white paper bands. Could they possibly
be meant for state umbrellas? The cords were black,
and looked as if made of hair. The front of the temple
was of stone, painted red, but the top of it looked as
if it consisted of billets of wood all laid close together,
of a dull red-brown. There was a brilliantly painted
colonnade, with outside staircase leading at intervals to
an upper verandah, all round the courtyard, excepting
just where stood the temple; and to its left a specially
gaudy house. In front of this latter was again a
collection of black hanging ropes, and on the top of
this a <i>human skull</i>!</p>

<p>While I was noticing all these details, Lamas all
in crimson, each with the right arm bare, continued
to troop into the courtyard and into the verandah
above, from which at first they looked down, making
eyes and smiling the Lama's smile upon a woman.
But suddenly, as a loud voice, with the tone of
authority, became audible in the distance, the smiles
vanished, and the Lamas stood round quite expressionless
with folded arms. I had just stepped forward to
examine more carefully that human skull, startled by
the horror of it amidst all the gorgeous colouring
around, when the blood rushed to my heart, as there
came a sound, and close upon the sound two large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
Tibetan dogs sprang out through an inner gateway
and made straight for me.</p>

<p>It passed through my mind at once, that it was
useless to try to quell Tibetan dogs, as one so often
quells Chinese dogs. I remembered that they are said
never to let go, and I knew now at once that voice
in authority had been ordering the dogs to be loosed.
Sick with terror, I yet thrust the iron point of my
alpenstock into the jaws of the foremost dog; but the
fierce creature, although with such tremendous leverage
against it, tore it from my grasp, and shook the long
stick in its teeth as if it had been a straw. My
husband sprang forward to the rescue, though still
holding our own little dog in his arms. One of our
coolies, a really brave, strong ex-soldier, followed him,
and together the two managed somehow to beat off
the dogs, and then we all ran for it. My recollection
is that to the last not a Lama&mdash;and there must have
been at least forty of them standing round, all draped
in crimson&mdash;moved a muscle even of his countenance.
We had bowed politely on entering, and asked leave;
but we did not bow as we came away thus hurriedly
to the sound of more and more dogs baying in the
distance.</p>

<p>There were shrines full of little clay pyramids
covered with images of Buddha; there were more and
finer prayer-slates by the principal entrance, by which
we came out. But whether the Lamas ever pray, God
knows, I don't!</p>

<p>As we passed back into the town again, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
shop from which a handsome woman, beautifully bejewelled,
had gone out that morning with her handmaid
to do her own washing in the pure glacier stream,
we heard a jolly laugh ring out from the same jovial
Lama we had left there talking to my handsome friend
as we passed out.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic priests here say that the
people believe in nothing except their Lamas, and we
feel a little inclined to think, if they believe in them,
it is no wonder that they believe in nothing else.
Whatever any one may think of missions in China&mdash;and
I am grieved as well as greatly surprised to find how
little interest people generally take in them&mdash;every one
must wish well to missionaries to Tibet; for the priesthood
must have an extraordinarily paralysing effect, that
this physically gifted people, still with princes of their
own, should have sunk under Chinese control, in spite
of the impregnable natural fastnesses of their mountains,
and the defence established by their climate. Whilst we
were there, in September, the thermometer varied from
56° to 60°, but the winds blew so keenly off the
glaciers that many people were wearing heavy furs,
and the price of them had already gone up.</p>

<p>Buying, indeed, we found most exhausting work at
Tachienlu. At home, when one feels like buying,
one goes to the shops; but the people who have
anything to sell drop in at Tachienlu from early
morning till late, late at night, merry rosy little maidens
with a keen eye to business, or wonderfully withered
old crones. They ask any price at first; then just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
they are going away say quietly, "What would you
like to give?" after which they stand out by the hour
for an additional half-rupee for themselves, to give
which a rupee has to be carefully cut in two. An
aged chieftain, with a most beautiful prayer-wheel and
rosary, both of which, he says, are heirlooms and
cannot be sold, brings a beautifully embroidered red
leather saddle-cloth for sale; while a Tibetan from the
interior brings first a Lama's bell, then cymbals, then
woollen clothes of soft, rich colours, and little serving-maids
appear with cast-off clothes, expecting us to
buy them all. It is interesting to notice how very
fashionable is a Tibetan lady's dress&mdash;a sleeveless gown,
that opens down the front like a tea-gown, a skirt
with box pleats so tiny and so near together as to
be almost on the top of one another, carefully fastened
down so as to lie quite flat, and lined at the bottom
with a broad false hem of coarse linen, so as to avoid
unnecessary weight. Yet even as it is, the weight of
this silk skirt is prodigious. Over this is worn a jacket,
and over this an apron girt round rather below the
waist with a variety of girdles. But it is hard to say
what a Tibetan girl really does wear, for the seventeen-year-old
daughter of the inn, finding herself rather
coming to pieces, began rectifying her toilette in my
presence, and I lost count of the garment below
garment that appeared in the process, all girdled rather
below the waist. The finish of the toilette, even in
ordinary life, seems to be an unlimited supply of
jewellery and dirt, the finger-nails, besides being deeply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
grimed, being also tinged with red. The men wear
turquoises in their hair, and often one gigantic earring,
besides rosaries and big amulet-cases. And the
general effect is so brilliant one rather loses sight of
the dirt. But indeed, after travelling through China,
it would be difficult to be much struck by dirt
anywhere.</p>

<p>It is very trying that they have such a very quick
perception of a camera. I have spent hours with a
detective half hidden behind a pile of woollens at
our window, and tried every expedient. But they are
said to think the photographer gets their soul from
them, and then has two to enjoy, whilst they themselves
are left soulless. At last, however, after a great deal
of coaxing, six Tibetan women stood up in a row,
encouraged to do so by the elder daughter of the inn,
who is married&mdash;though probably after the Tibetan
fashion&mdash;to a rich Yunnan merchant, who occupied
one wing of the courtyard, filling it with beautiful wild
men, but himself absorbed in his opium-pipe. I was
afraid to place them, or do anything beyond asking
the aged chieftain to leave off turning his prayer-wheel
for the one second while I took them, although I longed
to arrange them a little, and was disappointed that the
daughter of the inn had not put on any of the grand
clothes and jewellery she had exhibited to me.</p>

<p>The last day or two the yaks were coming into
town in droves to fetch the brick tea away. All those
we saw were black, although the yaks' tails for sale
were white. They were rather like Highland cattle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
for size, and seemed very quiet, although looking so
fierce, with long bushy manes and tails, and long shaggy
hair down their front legs. The last day we were at
Tachienlu we got a perfectly clear view of the snowy
mountains and glacier to the south, as we stood outside
the north gate beyond the magnificent alders there.
All that day we rode down the narrow granite defile
that leads up from the Tung, and then we heard it
really would be possible to cross the river and see the
Tibetan villages on its left bank, if we could walk for
two miles higher up to where there was a boat.</p>

<p>My husband was suffering from neuralgia, but he
very heroically consented to my going without him,
a proceeding which our Chinese servant so highly
condemned, that he became almost violent before I
started early next day with all four of the <i>yamen</i>
runners, sent by the Chinese Government to protect
us, and one of our soldier coolies to protect me from
the <i>yamen</i> runners. As the Tung would not be passable
again till we reached the city of the great chain
bridge, I had thus a long day to look forward to through
unknown country; and knowing how the Tibetans feel
about photography, there was a certain amount of
anxiety about the proceeding. But what a disappointment
awaited me! We walked the longest two miles
ever human being walked, till we came to the place
where the boat was on the <i>other</i> side of the river.
The coolie had run on ahead to hail it. But in spite
of his shouting no one moved in the village opposite.
We had been warned that nothing would induce the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
people to come across with the boat till they had
breakfasted, so we sat down and waited.</p>

<p>We saw a man and boy come out to till the ground.
The boy lay on his back, and looked at us and sang
to himself. All four <i>yamen</i> runners shouted, and
waved strings of cash. A shepherd came out with
a herd of goats, another with cows and goats. We
judged by the smoke that breakfasts were preparing.
We even saw one man come out upon his flat roof
with what we decided to be an after-breakfast pipe.
We thought he must come now. Yes! Surely there
was some one coming to the boat! No, it was a man
with a basket on his back, evidently wanting to cross
to our side. He sat down and waited. Presently
another man came out and sat down beside him. They
became quite happy, those two&mdash;setting to at once in
what probably is a never-ending occupation for them,
hunting 'mid their rags for vermin! Two other moving
bundles of rags came slowly down and joined them&mdash;one
apparently a man, the other looking rather like
a woman. They also sat and hunted! At last the
boy moved; he went to the village, we thought, to
call some one. Our hopes rose. All my men shouted
together. A man came to the water's edge! Another!
They looked at us. They looked at the boat. They
felt the boat, but they did not push it into the water;
and they went away. We were in despair. We made
feints of going, and then came back again. At last
there was nothing for it but to go really. The beggars
in their rags on the other side got uneasy then. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
even shouted to us, begging us to stop; but it was
of no use. Hours afterwards, as we coasted a granite
headland, we saw that boat still high and dry. I would
so gladly have risked my life in it.</p>

<p>But now, besides retracing our long two miles&mdash;now
under a burning sun&mdash;we had twenty-two miles to get
over in order to join the rest of our party and get shelter
for the night. It was a comfort to find some more
coolies with lanterns sent to meet us before we had to
cross the chain bridge, for there are often planks missing
in it and others with great holes in them. We went
across in a phalanx. I held on to the coolie on my left,
he reached an arm out to secure the man with the light,
and the coolie on my other side supported my elbow.
It seemed we got on best when we all went in step
together, although I should not have thought so. On
arriving, we found that, when our carrying coolies had
crossed, some <i>yamen</i> runners had attacked them, and in
the scuffle that ensued the fur coat of the coolie, who
had gone with me, had been stolen out of a basket. So
my husband was just starting for the <i>yamen</i> to tell the
tale. "I know all about it," said the magistrate, "and
it is quite true they were <i>yamen</i> runners, who acted
very wrongly. You want them punished? Behold!"
And the curtain behind him was drawn back, and there
were two men with their heads in <i>cangues</i>. But the
coolie from whom the coat had been stolen stood up
before the magistrate, and stoutly maintained those
were not the men. "How could you know in the
confusion?" asked the magistrate. "Can you identify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
the men? If so, and these are not the right ones, I will
punish the others also."</p>

<p>So there we were, but not the fur coat! What a
comfort it was, though, to rest after that long, hot day!
And how luxurious to be carried next day in a sedan-chair
along the beautiful banks of the swift-flowing
Tung! Then six days' travelling, against time now,
along the great brick-tea road, through scenes of varying
beauty, among gigantic ferns and waxen begonias nestling
into the walls, past long ranges of black-and-white
farm-buildings, shadowed by large, beautiful shade-trees;
a day and a half on a bamboo raft down the exceedingly
pretty but turbulent Ya, with the waves washing up
to our knees at all the bad rapids; after which five
days down the conjoined rivers Ya, Tung, and Yangtse;
and then home in Chungking again, after the most
adventurous and by far the most varied and interesting
summer outing that it has yet fallen to my lot to make.

</div>

<p>Even if I had the knowledge, it would be useless
to attempt to write exhaustively of Chinese
porcelain in one chapter; but a few shreds of information
about it may be new to the general reader. Julien's
theory that it was first made between the years 185 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>
and <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 87 is set aside by Dr. Hirth, the greatest living
authority upon ancient Chinese porcelain. The latter
believes it was first made during the T`ang Dynasty,
which lasted to <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 907; but there are no specimens
of porcelain extant before the Sung Dynasty, which
ended in 1259, the majority even then being of the class
known as "celadons," which survived owing to their
thickness and strength. The prevailing colour of these
celadons is green, the colour of jade; and yellow is mentioned
as one of the ingredients used for producing this
colour. They were mostly made in the south-west of
the province of Chekiang, taken by river to the Amoy
waters, and thence distributed by Arab traders to Japan,
Borneo, Sumatra, the west of Asia, and the east coast
of Africa, in which last, curiously enough, large numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
have been discovered. They have been freely imitated
at King-teh-chen, the great porcelain factory of China,
as well as in Japan; but collectors should, it seems,
have no difficulty in distinguishing the genuine articles,
from their extreme hardness.</p>

<p>The safest guide to Chinese porcelain is Hsiang-tse-ching,
who was collecting and cataloguing it whilst
Shakespeare was writing his early poems, and whose
richly illustrated catalogue has been translated. The
most exquisite Chinese porcelain seems to have perished
from its fragility, and the extraordinarily large demands
of the Imperial Palace had apparently in old days the
same effect European demands are said to have now.
When the Palace ordered a hundred thousand pairs
of cups or vases&mdash;the Chinese always want pairs&mdash;naturally
the Government factories were obliged to
supplement the most expensive and rare colours by
others less costly and more simple, whilst the highest
order of artistic excellence had to give way to mechanical
repetition. Modern collectors get the bulk of their
specimens from the dispersion of articles furnished to
meet such vast orders; and the Ming porcelain is
naturally somewhat coarse in make, faulty in shape,
and decorated with paintings which, though characterised
by boldness of design, have usually been executed
without much care.</p>

<p>The ancient bronzes of China only became an object
of interest to Chinese collectors about eight centuries
ago. From that date on great attention has been paid
to the inscriptions upon ancient vases, and it is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
difficult to deceive Chinese archæologists, from their
thorough knowledge of their own past history. A
vase dating from the Chow Dynasty, and preserved
at Silver Island near Chinkiang, has attracted especial
attention. A former Viceroy of Kwangtung, Yuen-yuen,
writing at the beginning of this century, describes his
visit to Silver Island to see this vase. He examined
it critically, and described it minutely in his four-volume
archæological collection. He studied its colour, shape,
and dimensions, and especially the inscriptions of forty
characters. He was himself a scholar of the highest
attainments, and his judgment in regard to the epoch
to which this valuable relic of former ages belongs
has been accepted and endorsed by succeeding scholars.
The vase was much coveted by the notorious Yen-sung,
an unprincipled statesman, who made great efforts to
add it to his private collection in Peking in the Ming
Dynasty. Yuen-yuen refers to these abortive designs,
because, Yen-sung being a good judge of all relics of
old times, this is an additional testimony to the genuine
antiquity of the vase, and it indicates the deep interest
felt in it by the archæologists of the Ming Dynasty.
Beside the descriptions of it in the ordinary works which
give details on bells and vases generally, monographs
have been published on this particular vase showing
that the best-informed native scholars are at one in
the regard felt for it as genuine.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago the <i>Chin Shih So</i> was published,
and this work with its profuse illustrations helped to
spread the knowledge both of the new-found Han
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
Dynasty sculptures and of the earlier bronze vessels.
Rich men and scholars became sensible of the great
pleasure to be derived from archæological research.
And this has become a real feature of modern Chinese
life. Men of means and leisure visit all celebrated monuments
to study them for themselves, and take back with
them rubbings to preserve at home. The large demand
that there is in China for rubbings of ancient inscriptions
is very remarkable. The bells and vases have now,
like the stone drums, after much cautious inquiry and
no little collision of opinion, secured a place stronger
than ever in the judgment of the well informed in the
Chinese reading class.</p>

<p>"It was about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 166 that a king of Rome sent
an embassy which arrived from the borders of Annam,
bringing tribute of ivory, rhinoceros-horn, and tortoise-shell.
From that time began the direct intercourse with
that country. The fact that no jewels were found among
the articles of tribute must be accounted for by the
supposition that the ambassadors retained them for
themselves." In the following century, the third, Western
traders resorted to Canton; so that it appears the
Cantonese have been afflicted by the presence of barbarians
for no less than sixteen hundred years. Possibly
this explains how the Mæander pattern on old Chinese
bronzes so resembles the Greek "key" pattern, and
why the lions' heads at the approach to the tomb of
the first Ming Emperor at Nanking have rings in their
mouths, thus exactly resembling the lions' heads so often
to be seen on the mahogany cellarettes of our grandfathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
possibly also why the Chinese Buddhist ritual
and that of Roman Catholics are so strikingly similar.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Hirth, paper already existed in
China in the second century. But to leave these
ancient researches and come down to modern times.</p>

<p>It was a real pleasure to me at Kiukiang to see
Chinamen hammering away at silver ornaments exactly
after the method advocated in Mr. Leland's (Hans Breitmann's)
excellent volume in the Art at Home Series,
and just as so many amateurs are now making admirable
brasswork at home&mdash;laying a thin sheet of metal on
pitch, and working at the background with a hammer
and sharpened nail or punch, thus making the pattern,
previously traced out, start into high relief. The more
roughly this work is done, the handsomer is its effect;
so that it seems better suited for brass sconces for
candles or doorplates than for silver hair ornaments.
But it was pleasant to find these Chinamen in their
little shops provided with a plentiful supply of sharpened
nails, together with the familiar punches.</p>

<p>It is not an equal pleasure to study modern Chinese
paintings. Centuries have passed since they were what
we must imagine from the story of Wu Taotze, the
Chinese Giotto, who flourished in the eighth century.
It is related that, when he was commanded to paint
a landscape upon the walls of the great Hall of Audience
at the Palace, he begged that he might work alone
and undisturbed. When he announced that all was
ready, the Emperor and the Court, on entering, found
the artist standing alone in front of a great curtain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
"As the folds of drapery rolled away, a marvellous
and living scene was spread out before the amazed
spectators,&mdash;a vast perspective of glade and forest, hill
and valley, with peaceful lakes and winding streams,
stretching away to a far horizon closed in by azure
mountain-peaks; and in a wild, rocky foreground, in
the very front of the picture, stood a grotto, its entrance
closed by a gateway. 'All this, sire, is as naught,'
said the painter, 'to that which is concealed from
mortal gaze within.' Then at a sign the gate opened,
and he passed through, beckoning his royal master.
But in a moment, before the entranced Emperor could
move a step, the whole eerie prospect faded away,
leaving the blank and solid wall. And Wu Taotze
was never seen again."</p>

<p>"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard&mdash;&mdash;"
The pictures that never were painted, the poems
that never were written!&mdash;the Chinese thought it all
out long ago, how those that were only imagined were
the best. And yet we think them a people without
sentiment or artistic sensibility&mdash;we, with our fairest
scenes disfigured by coarse advertisements, every silken
detail in our theatres given us by Mr. So-and-so, only
the acting left out.</p>

<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little</i></p>
</div>

<p>The glorious white falcon attributed to the Emperor
Hui Tsung at the beginning of the twelfth century
and the exquisite pictures of flowers and birds to
be seen at the British Museum show whence the
Japanese borrowed their art inspiration; but in China,
its birthplace, it is wanting now, though probably in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
many rich official residences glorious specimens are still
to be found such as I have myself been delighted by
in Japan, where alone and at the British Museum I
have seen Chinese masterpieces of painting. Before
Giotto was born the Chinese were painting living human
figures such as they cannot paint now. It is, however,
true that in Chungking, the only Chinese city I know
really well, there is to this day an artist who paints
flowers as a connoisseur, the head of an English technical
school, pronounced only one man in England could.
And how does this poor artist sell his pictures? Of
course, it will never be believed in England that he is
an artist at all, when I tell the sad truth&mdash;he sells
them by the square foot! And when you decide to buy
a picture, he&mdash;measures it!</p>

<p>The popularly received opinion is that there is no
architecture in China. Houses and temples alike are
built with wooden pillars, raised off the ground upon
stone bases. The roofs are placed upon the pillars,
and only when the roofs are finished are the walls built
up like screens. The proportions often strike me as
very beautiful; and the cunningly contrived perspectives
add much to their dignity. But, as in Japan, whilst
moved to admiration by the approach, one often has
a disappointed feeling of not arriving at anything in
the end. At the same time, the conception of a Chinese
house, like the design of Peking, strikes me as very
lordly; the courtyards are extremely graceful and elegant,
whilst the beautiful sweep of the roofs makes European
roofs painfully mean by comparison. Indeed, a European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
house now usually gives me the same effect as a face
would divested of eye-lashes. The Chinese roofs in the
west of China and at Peking are, however, far more beautiful
than those generally to be seen along the east coast.</p>

<p>To turn to Chinese industries. When tea was first
discovered, all sorts of medicinal properties were attributed
to it. It is to be hoped the virtue lay rather,
as we are told now it does with whisky-and-water, in
the hot water; for if not, what does the poor Tibetan
get out of the <i>£</i>150,000 he is said to spend on tea
at Tachienlu, the frontier city&mdash;for 65 per cent. of wild
scrub leaves, scrub oak, etc., are said to be mixed up
in the brick tea he receives? And the cost of the
tea in the Tachienlu market is nearly doubled before
the Tibetan receives it at Batang; at Lassa it has
quadrupled its price. It is only for the last four
centuries the Tibetans have had silver to exchange for
tea; till then it was exchanged for horses, a good horse
being valued at 240 lb. of tea. Even to this day the
tea trade is much too limited for the four million of
Tibetans; and the many thousand Tibetans who cannot
afford tea use oak bark instead, astringency being the
quality they desire to relieve them from headache and
excessive meat-eating. The tea trade with Russia still
thrives; but that with Europe has been killed by the
much more carefully grown and prepared tea of Ceylon
and India&mdash;though melancholy experience must ere long
teach people that this tea has altogether other and more
undesirable properties than the soothing, refreshing
beverage of China.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_0452" id="i_0452"></a>
<img src="images/i_0452.jpg" width="522" height="399" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PACKING TEA.</p>
</div>

<p>It is, however, no wonder that the China tea
trade has languished. Home industries are universal
in China, and each peasant who farms a bit of land
grows his tea, picks it and dries it, according to his
own ideas. To introduce any improvement it would
be therefore necessary to educate the great mass of
peasant cultivators. European tea-buyers' exhortations
have so far proved fruitless; and it is distressing to
see the utter want of care with which the tea-plant,
with its glossy green leaves and delicate white blossom,
is treated, compared with the untiring labour expended
upon the poisonous poppy-plant. The latter is carefully
weeded, planted in regular lines, with the earth mounded
round its roots, and presents an appearance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
most perfect vigorous health, with its erect stalk over
five feet high, its blue-green leaves, and beautiful
blossoms. Sometimes it stands out brilliant crimson
against a transcendently blue sky, making the eyes
ache with the gorgeous colour contrast; at others it is
white, delicately fringed and pink-tipped, or pink, or
scarlet, or scarlet and black, or with the purple of the
purple iris, or oftenest of all&mdash;and perhaps, after all, most
beautiful&mdash;white of that frail fair whiteness that makes it
impossible to think of crime or vice as connected with
it&mdash;impossible even to believe in the existence of so
foul a weed as vice being able to exist in a world
that produces so frail and pure a flower, able to stand
upright in the full heat of a China noonday sun and
remain unwilted. The tea-shrubs, on the other hand,
are old and gnarled, planted irregularly just anywhere,
and never by any chance weeded. The same want
of care is shown in the drying of the young leaves,
picked just as they are opening out off their young
shoots. At the same time, if Scotland would take to
China tea, there would not be so many cases of tea-poisoning
as there now are in Glasgow; but the
beverage is a mild one, that must seem tasteless to
whisky-drinkers. It has the further apparent disadvantage
that an equal amount of leaf will not make
anything like the same strength of decoction that Indian
tea will.</p>

<p>China silk is also in a bad way; but, indeed, all
over the world now it seems difficult to get healthy
silkworm eggs. To turn, however, to an especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Chinese industry, and one which still seems to me even,
after seeing it, to border on the marvellous&mdash;the white
or vegetable wax of China. The processes essential
to its use began about six centuries ago. The tree
which produces the white wax insect grows in the
Chienchang valley, on the far or western side of the
unconquered Lolos, a valley about five thousand feet
above the level of the sea. The Kew authorities
pronounce that this tree is the <i>Ligustrum lucidum</i>, or
large-leaved privet, an evergreen with very thick dark-green
glossy foliage, bearing clusters of white flowers
in May and June, succeeded afterwards by fruit of a
dark-purple colour. In March brown excrescences
become visible, attached to the branches; and if these
be opened, a crowd of minute insects, looking like flour,
will be discovered. Two or three months later these
develop into a brown insect with six legs. And as
the Chinese have discovered that these insects would
not continue to flourish on the trees, their birthplace,
they make them up into paper packets of about sixteen
ounces each; and porters, each carrying sixty of these
packets, hurry by night along the dangerous mountain
paths to Kiating, a city about two hundred miles to
north and east, and place them there on severely
pollarded trees of the <i>Fraxinus chinensis</i>. It is this
flight by night that has always fascinated my imagination,
even before I traversed the successive high
mountain passes, descending into the valleys over-grown
by ferns and lit up every here and there by
waxy clusters of the beautiful begonia flower that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
there flourishes as a wallflower. But it would be
impossible to carry the insects through the noonday
heat, as it would develop them too fast. Therefore,
at the season of the carriage of the insect, all the
city gates along the route have to be left open at
night to facilitate the passage of the army of running
porters. And to think of the rough, rocky ascents
and descents those poor porters have to stumble
along! The packages of insects are each wrapped in
a leaf of the wood-oil tree; rice straw is used to
suspend the packet under the branches of the ash-tree;
rough holes are drilled in the leaf with a blunt
needle, so that the insects may find their way out;
and they creep rapidly up to the leaves of the ash-tree,
where they nestle for about thirteen days. They
then descend to the branches, and the females begin
to develop scales on which to deposit their eggs, and
the males to excrete what looks like snow as it coats
the under side of the boughs and twigs, till at the
end of three months it is a quarter of an inch thick.
The branches are then lopped off, and the wax removed,
chiefly by hand, and placed in an iron pot of
boiling water, where it rises to the surface, is skimmed
off, and deposited in a rough mould. This is then
the extraordinary hard white wax of commerce, used
to coat the ordinary tallow candles, and give the
tallow greater consistence, thus enabling the Chinese to
carry tallow candles about in the paper lanterns that
supply still the place of lamps, gas, and electric lighting
for the greater part of China. It is used also to size
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
paper and cotton goods, as furniture polish, and to
impart a gloss to silk.</p>

<p>There is a tribute of white wax sent every year
to Peking; and to see it going down-river in native
junks, or being trans-shipped from that more romantic
mode of travel into an ordinary steamer, has a certain
fascination for me: but the real romance about the
white wax is that hurried midnight journey across
the Szechuan mountains before it has ever come into
the world at all. And it rather spoils the interest than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
otherwise to be told such dry facts as that from Hankow
every year fifteen thousand piculs of white vegetable
wax are exported, Chinkiang, Tientsin, Canton, and
Swatow each requiring one thousand piculs, Shanghai
absorbing seven thousand, and exporting four thousand
more to other places. But any one who has been
benighted on a lonely hillside or on the banks of
some unknown river knows the transport of delight
with which a light in the distance is recognised. With
what joy one gradually convinces oneself it is coming
towards one, and in the end has to restrain oneself
from embracing the always sympathetically joyful
lantern-bearer; and so in those twinkling lights along
little-trodden paths, or in scattered Chinese homesteads
of many curves and courtyards, once more the romance
attaching to the white wax reasserts itself.</p>

<p>Grass-cloth is another very interesting Chinese industry.
It is produced from a nettle, and with large
wooden things like butter-pats and a rough bamboo
thumb-protector the women beat out the fibre on the
threshing- or drying-floor in front of the farmsteads.
I often wonder grass-cloth is not more common in
England. Perhaps it lasts too long to pay to import.
It is very cool, and like a glossy kind of linen, but
far more durable. Cotton goods are made at home.
They do not crease as our cottons do; they let the
air through like cellular goods, and are therefore very
wholesome wear in summer; and they last for ever.</p>

<p>Ningpo carvings, fanciful and rich, but in rather
perishable wood, Canton ivory carvings, and silks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
generally, are too well known to need description.
Only, till I went to China, I had no idea new patterns
of silks came out nearly every year even in that most
conservative country, and are much sought after. Fans
are recorded as having been used to keep the dust
from the wheels of the chariots as far back as the
Chow Dynasty, 1106 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> Ivory fans were invented
by the Chinese 991 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>; but it was not till the fifteenth
century the folding-fan, long before invented by the
Japanese, found its way into China. In the west of
China it is, however, still not etiquette to carry such
a fan to a party; for it looks as if you had no servant
to stand behind your chair and hold it for you when
you do not want it. The Chinese ivory fans are carved
all over right through till the whole looks like lace,
the part not taken up by the design being very
delicately cut in short perpendicular lines.</p>

<p>But probably the art and industry carried to the
greatest perfection in China is that of embroidery.
English people do not appreciate what Chinese embroideries
really are, because such a quantity of work
is done by men working at frames, and merely for so
much a day. The best has always been done by
ladies, working at home, and putting all the fancy of
a lifetime into a portière, or bed-hanging. One of
the most fairylike pieces of embroidery I have ever
seen was mosquito-curtains worked all over with clusters
of wistaria for either the Emperor or Empress, and
somehow or other bought, before being used, out of
the Imperial Palace by a European collector. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
rich yet delicate work upon the very fine silky material
made these mosquito-curtains a thing to haunt the
dreams of all one's after-life.</p>

<p>Whilst, however, the handiwork of the Chinese
appears to me unsurpassed, and their colour arrangements
in old days, before the introduction from Europe
of aniline dyes, are much more agreeable to me than
those of Japan, there seems to be nothing to satisfy
the soul in Chinese artistic work, which gratifies the
senses, but appeals to none of the higher part of
man. I should, however, say quite the same of that
of Japan, which got all its art originally from China,
and has never, I think, quite arrived at the ancient
dignity of Chinese art, although at the present day
Japan's artistic work is certainly far more graceful
and pleasing.</p>

<p>One day in the neighbourhood of Shanghai we
walked along a path where, marvellous for China, two
people could walk abreast, and, crossing a variety of
creeks in a variety of ways, came upon the ruins of a
camp, finally reaching two tall chimneys, a landmark
in the scene. Our puzzle was what fuel they could
possibly find to burn inside those tall chimneys. It
turned out to be rice husks. A man sat on the ground,
and with one hand worked a bellows, thus making
forced draught, while with the other he threw on a tiny
handful of rice husks, not enough to choke the bright
flame roused by the draught. Another man weighed
out crushed cotton seeds into a little basket, emptied
them into a vessel on the fire till it just boiled, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
emptied them again into another vessel&mdash;if you can call
it such&mdash;a sort of frame of split bamboo twisted, kneaded
it, all hot as it was, with his feet, and then piled it
up ready to be pressed, always with a bit of basket-work
flattening it on the top. We waited to see the
cakes pressed. They were like cheeses, each with
their twisted bamboo rings round them. When as many
as could be were fitted into the trough, then by putting
in wedges the bulk was reduced to rather less than
half what it at first appeared, during which time a
constant stream of oil was flowing through the trough.
A man hammered the wedges, towards the end using
a stone hammer so heavy I could only just lift it.
It was rather amusing to see the politeness of these
men. One of them wanted to smoke. But before
doing so he offered his pipe both to my husband and
to myself, quite with the air of expecting his offer
to be accepted. I had an ulster, and they all admired
the material of it very much, saying each in turn they
were quite sure it was <i>pi chi</i> (long ells). There were
buffaloes crushing the cotton seeds, walking round and
round with basket-work blinkers over their poor eyes.
Curiously enough, the heavy millstones they wheeled
round, all of hardest granite as they were, yet were
decorated with carvings. One had the key pattern,
or a slightly different scroll; also characters, very carefully
carved, to the effect that it was the fairy carriage
and the dragon's wheel.</p>

<p>It seemed strange to come upon this touch of
æstheticism in this very homely sort of factory, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
whole plant must have cost so very little, and which
was in consequence, though so well adapted for its
purpose, yet so simple that it might well serve as an
illustration for an elementary primer in mechanics.
Indeed, this factory at home, and in the fresh air,
was the very ideal Ruskin writes about, and that the
Village Industries Society at home has lately been
formed to realise, if yet it may be, in England. It has
been realised during long centuries in China, and yet
the millennium has not arrived.</p>

<p>We went back through a long, crowded, flourishing
street. At an open doorway there were young priests
sitting inside, chanting. They had musical instruments
and gongs. A man behind a table was very busy
stamping envelopes such as Chinese officials use, very
large and covered with characters. He was good
enough to pause, and show us the letters these envelopes
were to contain, very long and beautifully written,
and most neatly and cunningly folded. There was
some one very ill in the house, and these letters were
addressed to heaven, describing circumstantially his
sad case. They were presently to be burnt, and thus
delivered. The lanterns with which this house was decorated
were blue for semi-mourning. Only a few doors
farther off, curiously enough, we came upon a wedding.
The doors stood wide open, and we saw a long vista
of courtyards and <i>ting-tzes</i>, all with open doors, and
at the end what I fancied were a number of smartly
dressed servants standing. There was a band in the
first courtyard, with the quaint, pretty-looking instruments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
of crocodile-skin which I had before so much
admired in Shanghai Chinese city. Every one seemed
so obliging, I asked to look inside the wedding-chair.
It was remarkably smart, really beautifully embroidered
all over outside. But, to my intense disgust, the
cushion on which the bride was to sit was an old
common red cushion, worn at the corners, and actually
dirty, and the inside of the chair had not even been
swept out.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<i>A LITTLE PEKING PUG.</i></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Enjoyment.&mdash;Anticipation.&mdash;Regret.
</p>
</div>

<p>He was only six months old when we first knew
him, with long silky ears, and a little head
covered with delicate yellow down, undeveloped puppy
body, but a grand white chest, and black muzzle; he
had fine long moustachios and long black eyelashes,
from between which looked out engaging lustrous eyes
of a singularly intelligent expression. He weighed
just about three pounds at his utmost; and when he
stretched himself to his greatest length, he was only
a hand and a half long. But his port and his attitudes
were those of a lion, or, when engaged in worrying
a piece of cord dangled invitingly before him, for all
the world just like those of a Chinese monster, only
in miniature. In some ways he was like a kitten rather
than a puppy, so graceful and gentle in his movements,
with long claws, too, at the tips of his little
feathery feet, and a way of purring when he was
pleased. He made many little plaintive sounds, as if
he were talking to himself; and sometimes it almost
seemed as if he were talking to other people too, so
articulate were they. His tail was his weak point&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
was too long. But some
people said, that as he
grew older it would curl
up and look shorter. We
do not know if this would
have been so, nor whether
his body might have developed
into being too
long or too thin, or something.
In size he was like a puppy, and his
head and chest were lovely. It was very difficult to
avoid treading upon him, he was so small and noiseless
in his movements. So he wore three little
rattles round his throat, for he was too small to
wear real Peking bells. And it was extraordinary the
genius the little creature had for crying out before
he was hurt, and as if he had been half killed too.
But no one ever saw little Shing-erh&mdash;Little Apricot,
as he was called, from his colour&mdash;put out, or angry
about being hurt. He was always pleased, always full
of life, ready to fall off fast asleep, or spring up wide
awake, without a moment's notice, and never afraid of
any person or thing.</p>

</div>

<p>When bought of a Chinaman in the streets of Peking,
he showed no distrust, but nestled at once into European
arms, went home in them, and growled when strangers
approached his master's door, or sprang up delighted
to welcome his master himself. He was carried about
in a coat pocket, or sat in an office drawer, gravely
watching the writing of manifests by the hour together;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
or at times trotted gaily through the streets, ever
and anon stopping to sniff out some to him perfectly
delicious bit of nastiness. Who so delighted as little
Shing-erh, when he found out he could actually run up
the stairs to the dining-room? And from that moment
he was always fancying it luncheon-time or dinner-time;
for there was no doubt of one thing&mdash;the little sleeve-dog
did enjoy being fed. He enjoyed caresses also.
If he would not come when he was called, there was
always one way to secure his attention, and that was
to pet Wong, our other dog, a Shantung pug, about
five times Shing-erh's size. Then the little one would
come at once. Poor Wong! He had been used to being
called 'Little Wong,' and treated accordingly, and at
first he growled, and even bit the new-comer. After
that he looked heartbroken for a day or two, went home
by himself when taken out walking, and resisted all the
little one's efforts to draw him into a game of romps,
till an idea struck him, and he began to jump on to
sofas and armchairs; for did he not see the little one
on them made much of? Once he even jumped right
up into my lap, and tried to nestle there. And he tried
to bite bits of cord, or our hands. But his teeth were
very different from the tender milk-teeth of the little
sleeve-dog, who could not bite any one if he tried.
So these advances of his had to be summarily repelled.
And gradually, though somewhat sadly, Wong reconciled
himself to the situation; submitted to everyone's offering
the little one crumbs of delicacy, while he sat up on
his hind legs unnoticed, although chin-chinning beautifully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
with his two front paws; submitted when the little
one bit his ears, or flew at his eyes, or pulled his tail,
in order to attract his attention; and even condescended
to be played with occasionally.</p>

<p>It was a great affair taking little Shing-erh out;
for he found the world so full of interest, and would
look round with intelligent eyes, wagging his tail, as
much as to say, "All right! but look what a delightful
place I find myself in." It was impossible to be angry
with him, though it made progress through the streets
very slow at times. Then when one took him up and
carried him as a sort of punishment&mdash;for he did dearly
love to run&mdash;he would look so grave and serious, one
longed to see him frolicking once more. The only way
was to walk very fast; then the four little feet would
go galloping along, the tiny puppy bent on showing
he could run as fast as other people. He was never
afraid of any dog, but quite big dogs used to run away
from him, he was so lionlike in his advances; and when
he went to pay a visit to any other dog, he always
first drove his host into a corner with his tail between
his legs. Then only would the little one make up to
him, and gradually they would have a game of romps
together. But just because we were so fond of him
he was a great anxiety; for any Chinaman could put him
up his sleeve and run away with him quite easily. And
every one took a fancy to him; though not every one, like
two sweet little children, asked first if they might carry
him, next if they might kiss puppy-dog, and finally if they
might exchange a baby-sister of the same age for him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span></p>

<p>One day, holding him up for a child to stroke, I
noticed that the little one's breath, till then always so
sweet, smelt a little. It had been very cold coming
up-river in the winter weather, and it was still colder
going on, damp and raw; and we hardly knew how
to keep ourselves warm, much less the little puppy-dog.
So it seemed hard to prevent him from lying
close to the stove; but possibly it was that which made
him ill. Or it may have been the little bones people
gave him on the steamers. Every one used to ask
deferentially, "May I give the little dog this? There
is no meat on it." But there was a little meat sometimes,
and all the while there was poor Wong begging
unnoticed. But, then, Wong was very particular what
he ate&mdash;he liked some things, disliked others; while
as to little Shing-erh, we never found out what he did
not like to eat whilst he was well. But now we noticed
he no longer cared to play. He would take a run
outside for a little while, he dearly loved to forage under
the dinner-table, and pick up stray crumbs; otherwise
he wanted always to be nursed, making little cooing
sounds of satisfaction as he curled himself up on one's
lap, his little feathery head and long ears showing off to
great advantage as he did so. He was learning to sit
up like Wong and beg too, and even did so sometimes
without anything to lean his feeble puppy back against;
and he had almost learnt to give a paw when asked.
We used to talk of all we were going to teach him,
believing firmly that nothing was beyond our puppy's
capacity. We used to think how pleasant it would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
when our new house was built and the garden laid out,
and the little one could run freely about in it without
anxiety as to his being stolen. But from the day we
arrived up-country, it became increasingly evident that
something was amiss
with our tiny dog.
He could not eat
biscuit soaked in milk,
his regular food whilst
in Shanghai. He refused
rice, unless fish
were mixed with it.
He showed himself
ravenous for fish.
Perhaps it would
have been wiser to
have been guided by
the little creature's
preferences. But
bones and meat were
always very attractive
to him, and they could
hardly have been the best food. He did not want to run
after the first few days, sitting down upon his haunches,
looking very serious when set down. How the country
people admired him, when we carried him about, calling
him, "Little sleeve-dog," "Cat-dog," "Little lion,"
and asking leave to stroke him, or stroking him without
leave. "He comes from Peking," they would say;
and they looked at him with pride and pleasure.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span></p>

<p>At last a day came when we despaired of his life.
A Chinaman said, "Let me take him, and nurse him.
I think I can cure him. You see, he is a Chinese
dog, and you do not understand how to treat him. I
can be with him all the while." So from our great
love for him we let him go in his little quilted
basket, with his quilted coverlet of gay patchwork,
and little red pillow made expressly for himself,
because he was so fond of making a pillow of an
arm or a hand.</p>

<p>But in an hour or two he was brought back. He
had thrown in his lot with Europeans, and the little
Chinese dog would not eat from the hands of strange
Chinamen, nor do anything they wished. His eyes were
already glazed, and he seemed already half dead when
he was brought back. So because all seemed over, and
as if it did not matter what we did now, we held him
quite close to the stove and poured port-wine down his
throat. The little glazed eyes became limpid once more,
and he looked up, content to be with us. Then I sat with
him on my lap, thinking still of him as dead, and only
waiting for the end. But the little dog rallied so, that
that night, when taken upstairs, he struggled out of his
basket on to the bed, where he had always loved best
to sleep. He liked to lie there, with his little black-and-tan
head looking so droll on the white pillow. Put
down on the floor, for fear he should fall off&mdash;for, alas!
his little legs gave way under him, and he tottered once
as he tried to cross the bed&mdash;he actually ran about the
room, till he found the water-jug, stood up on his hind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
legs, and deliberately dipped his pretty head into it
and drank.</p>

<p>Perhaps that draught injured him, for the Chinese
declared cold water must be fatal to him. Anyway,
after that his rallying power appeared to have abandoned
him. But even then he still used to look up and listen
with great intensity when he heard his master's step
upon the stair, recognising that to the very last. But
though he lingered on all the next day and night,
and on into the next morning, he was always growing
weaker, till at last he could not swallow the spoonfuls
we gave him every two hours. Once or twice he had
fits of barking; but as he lay quite still and barked,
we hoped he was quite happy, thinking he was fighting
and vanquishing some other dog rather than suffering
pain. Yet after such long drawn out dying it was a
relief in the end when on the twelfth day up-country
we saw the little thing lie quite still and stiff; though,
as we looked at the graceful little head curled round
with its two silky ears, our eyes filled with tears, and
we felt almost as if we had lost a child.</p>

<p>The little dog had been of no use, and required
much looking after; yet he had endeared himself to
all who knew him. His dainty ways, his bright good
humour, and intense pleasure in the society of his friends
perhaps accounted for this. And yet our hearts smote
us as, after the little one was taken from us, and we
stooped to caress poor faithful Wong with a warmth
to which of late he had been unaccustomed, the honest
creature sprang on to the seat beside me with extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
effusiveness, and began leaping about and
catching at our hands with the exuberance of long-repressed
affection. Next night, though provided with
a beautiful kennel full of straw downstairs, Wong slept
out in the cold and rain in the courtyard outside our
door, as he had been used to do in the old days. We
tried to pet him, and make up for our loss by being
additionally kind to all other dogs we saw. But when
I see the pencil I once gave Shing-erh to gnaw, with
all the marks of his little teeth, or his little rattles,
the aching comes again to my heart, thinking of what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
might have been, and how if we had known better we
might perhaps have preserved the life of the pretty
pet, who so implicitly trusted and relied upon us.</p>

<p>As the intensest feelings ever become less intense
if spoken about, so that in all ages the greatest danger
has been for teachers of religious faith lest they should
themselves cease to feel whilst infusing faith in others,
so I have sought to take the edge off my grief by
writing some account of little Shing-erh, aged twelve
months when he died. Anyhow, whenever we leave
China behind us, there will be a tenderer feeling in
our hearts whilst thinking of the blue-gowned race,
because of this little creature born and bred amongst
Chinamen, and yet so engaging, so fastidious in all
his ways, and so entirely without any fear.</p>

<p>Since then Wong is dead; and Jack, our faithful
friend, and constant companion during nine years of
travel, a beautiful long-haired terrier from Shantung,
he too lies in a little grave, though his lustrous, intelligent
eyes haunt me still. Let no one lightly enter
on a Chinese dog as companion; they make themselves
too much beloved, become too completely members of
the family. Even Nigger, the black Chow dog that
my husband kept before our marriage, and whose
greeting he looked forward to all the long voyage out
to China&mdash;even Nigger seems like a living personality
to me, and I can hardly believe I never saw him.
Beloved dogs, companions of a life too solitary, because
amongst an uncompanionable race, Requiescant in pace!
Good-bye, Shing-erh! good-bye, Jack! Others may,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
but I can never look upon your like again. There
must be some subtle unnoticed quality in the Chinaman
to breed such dogs; and the sweet little Szechuan
ponies, miniature race-horses in form, and almost human
in their intelligence, are fitting companions for the dogs,
and doglike in their faithful, cheerful friendliness.</p>

<p>It was in 1888 we first arrived in Peking, and we
felt at once convinced that, whatever wonders it
might have to offer, nothing&mdash;no! nothing could surpass
the wonder of the journey. And when it is considered
that every high official throughout the empire had to
travel this same way in order to be confirmed in each
appointment, the wonder of it is enhanced. From
Tientsin you could always ride to Peking, if you were
strong enough. Sir Harry Parkes did it in the day,
the year before he died. But if not equal to riding
eighty miles at a stretch, or eighty miles relieved (?)
by nights at Chinese inns, you had in 1888 to travel
the way we did, taking boat up the Peiho as far as
Tungchow.</p>

<p>We left Tientsin at two o'clock on Thursday, and
reached Tungchow at 9 p.m. on Sunday, having been
very lucky, as it appeared. We had a south-west

wind all Friday, spinning us along certain reaches
of the ever wriggling, rather than winding Peiho.
Along the reverse reaches the men had to tow or
pole us. On Saturday the wind was so high that
we had to lie to in the middle of the day, the men
being unable to make any way against it by towing.
And we only made a very few miles that day. In
the afternoon it rained, and was altogether cheerless.
But on Sunday we had a fine westerly wind blowing
us on. Although a river, the Peiho in this part of
its course is decidedly more canal-like and uninteresting
than the English canal down which I had had some
thought of travelling the year before, till I decided
it would be too tedious. But after all there is a charm
about this exceedingly slow method of progression.
The world does not really stand still with you, but
you feel as if it did. You get interested in the boats
you pass and meet; some coming down stream, laden
with plants in pots&mdash;two dwarf orange-trees, with
oranges on them, I saw once&mdash;or bringing down straw
braid, or taking up brick tea&mdash;such quantities of brick
tea, which had, I suppose, come all the way down the
Yangtse from poor water-beleaguered Hankow of the
willow avenues and ravening mosquitoes, and round
farther by sea from Shanghai to Tientsin, and whose
progress on strings and strings of dignified camels
Siberiawards we subsequently saw. What brick tea
costs in the original instance I do not know. But when
I think of the labour expended on its transport I feel
it ought to be precious indeed to the Siberians.

<p class="caption">INTERIOR OF GOVERNOR'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE AT HANGCHOW.</p>
</div>

<p>Every now and then we got out and walked along
the banks, looking backwards at the long zigzagging
procession of boats behind us, each with one large
sail, or at times each with a bare mast, looking like
a long line of telegraph-poles. And beside us was
the line of real telegraph-poles, forerunners of the
coming railway that has since been opened; and we
knew that the foreigners who would approach Peking
in the old historic manner were already numbered.
For there will be nothing to tempt people to provide
themselves with all the necessaries of life for a three
or four days' trip, now that the railroad is open and
you can book direct. There is nothing to be seen
upon the road that cannot be seen as well elsewhere,&mdash;mudbanks,
sandhills, millet- and sorghum-fields with
poor crops, fairly nice trees, fences gay with convolvulus
flowers, mud houses, mud roofs, and level mudbanks
crowded with all the disreputable refuse of a poor
Chinese village; then wood-cutters (one or two
substantial coffins stood out prominently alongside of
them; wood seems too precious for anything but coffins
in those parts), a mule and a pony ploughing, or a
donkey or an ox, never a pair of animals of the same
kind. All these one looks at with a pleasant interest
as one saunters or floats by. But you can see them
elsewhere; or you can never see them, and yet be none
the worse for the miss.</p>

<p>It is true that by the old method you could shut
yourself into the boat cabin, and study colloquial
Chinese according to Sir Thomas Wade, or write letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
home to say how you were enjoying yourself, or drink
tea, or smoke, just as your previous way of life disposed
you to act, there being no restraining influence further
than the size of the cabin. A native boat is not quite
as luxurious as a Shanghai house-boat, though it is well
enough, except in the matter of its being impossible to
open the cabin door from the inside. So that when we
were shut in, I always thought how, if the boat should
heel over, we should be drowned inside like mice in
a trap. Another exception must be made&mdash;not in
favour of the cracks which grow portentously larger,
as the boards shrink with the increasing dryness of
the air, and which must let in an inordinate draught
in winter, when the air is more cold than kindly. Even
towards the end of September we found it hard
enough to keep warm at night. We had two cabins,
but one was pretty well all bedstead, being a raised
ottoman sort of a place, under which boxes could be
put, and on which mattresses were laid. We had to
provide ourselves with everything we wanted, even to
a cooking-stove. But then we paid only nine and a
half dollars for our boat, including drink money. This
at the then rate of exchange was under thirty shillings.
The men fed themselves. So did we. It is tiresome
that, travelling in China, nothing is to be bought by
the way, beyond chickens and eggs, and sweet potatoes
(delicious!) and cabbage (horrible!). It is tiresome,
also, that the makers of tinned things do not put
dates upon their tins; therefore in the outports&mdash;which
Shanghai fine ladies always pronounce as if they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
only peopled by "outcasts"&mdash;people have to put up
with the tinned milk that somehow did not sell at
Shanghai. It is a pity that the local representatives of
the Army and Navy Stores do not see to this, and
put dates on their tins. It would be well worth
the "outcasts'" while to pay extra for recently tinned
butter and milk, if they could rely upon the dates.
As it was, our milk was very nearly butter, though it
could not quite be used for that, and it certainly was
not milk.</p>

<p>The Concession at Tientsin is either so far away
from the Chinese town, or so satisfactory to its inhabitants,
that they never stray away among the Chinese.
On landing at the bridge of boats in the native city,
while our servants made a few purchases, I found I
excited as much interest as if there had not been a
European colony within a thousand miles. It was,
however, a particularly friendly crowd that accompanied
me. A boy danced in front, clapping his hands, as if
to bid the people in the street make way; another boy
was very eager to point out all the sweet cakes he
thought nicest; two old women and an old man went
down on their knees to beg; an old man was washing
very old shoes upon the bridge; another was selling
odds and ends of old things, that looked as if they
never had been new. There were sweet potatoes
cooking; there were various other buyers and sellers,
and crowds passing by, both on foot and in boats.
Sometimes the bridge would be opened, sometimes
closed to let the foot passengers go by. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
always a crowd; whichever way of progress was open,
people were always progressing by it before it was
ready for them. Nobody pushed, nobody was rude;
every one appeared pleasant. But there, looking down
the long straight reach of the river, was the tall
tower of the ruined Roman Catholic Cathedral, recalling
the massacre of 1870&mdash;a massacre that might so easily
have embraced all the Europeans in the Concession,
had not the rain mercifully come down in torrents and
dispersed the mob. It did not seem possible, when we
were there, to think of any danger of the kind threatening
the exceptionally thriving-looking settlement.</p>

<p>I have not seen any Concession yet I liked the
look of so well as that of Tientsin. There is a
go-ahead look about the place, with all its goods stored
in heaps on the Bund with only matting over them,
instead of, as elsewhere, in warehouses; which makes
it contrast especially with Chefoo, that sleeping beauty,
whom no fairy prince has yet awakened. Perhaps,
when he does, the merry wives of China, who used
to resort there every summer, may find it hardly as
charming as it was in its tranquillity and freedom from
all restraint. But it was so tranquil, so absolutely
uneventful, that our summer month there seemed only
like a dream to look back upon. Its coast-line is beautiful;
but it is a coast-line with nothing behind it, as it
were&mdash;like the cat's smile in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
a grin and nothing more.</p>

<p>But it was at Tungchow in the old days that the tug
of war in getting to Peking used to begin. You had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
bought all your stores, and furnished your boat, and
spent days and nights in it; but all that was nothing to
the great business of getting to Peking. There were
thirteen miles yet to do, and the question was, How did
you mean to try to get over them? My own firm
conviction now is that the easiest way would have been
to get up very early in the morning and walk. But as
it was, I came into Peking in the traditional style, feet
foremost in a springless cart, holding on hard to either
side. We started at eleven in the morning from Tungchow,
paused for an hour at a wayside inn to eat and
rest, and did not reach Peking till six, only just before
the gates were closed. At first starting I thought the
accounts of the road had been exaggerated. It is true
it was so dusty at intervals I was more reminded of a
London fog than anything else. It is true I could not
leave go with either hand without getting a tremendous
bump on the head. But still I did not think the road
was quite as bad as I had expected. Alas! the road
was so bad we had not started by it at all, but were
simply getting along by a way the carts had made for
themselves. At Pa-li Chiao we came upon the real
grand stone road, with the grand bridge made by the
Ming Dynasty&mdash;when they moved their capital from
Nanking to Peking, in order better to repel invading
Tartar hordes&mdash;and never in the centuries since repaired
by the Tartar horde of Manchus, who at once conquered
them, when they thus obligingly put themselves within
easy reach at the very extreme limit of their vast
empire.

<p class="caption">FARMER AND WATER BUFFALOES.<br />

</div>

<p>There was the road, with huge blocks of stone,
some of them five feet long, and wide and thick in
proportion, but sometimes worn away, sometimes clean
gone. Now to hold on like grim death! How the
smartly varnished little carts with their blue tops kept
together at all I cannot imagine. But I know I
immensely respected
the mule
that could pull us
into and out of the
holes and ruts, into
which we dropped
with a veritable
concussion, not a
jolt. Of course it
was a new sensation&mdash;but
a new
sensation it can do
no one any good
to experience; and
before I had had
half an hour of it
I had had enough,
and asked for a
donkey. However, the donkey brought was so tiny that,
after a rest on its poor little thin back, I tried the cart
again. The road did not seem quite so bad as before,
until we got nearer the capital. Then&mdash;then I got out
and walked. There was no help for it. And walking
was decidedly less fatiguing. But an increasing crowd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
followed me. Every one spoke to me&mdash;I hope complimentarily.
Men selling clothes waved them at me, and
sang to invite purchase. It was hard work to avoid the
carts, and donkeys, and mules, and camels, and men
carrying things, and Manchu women with feet of the
natural size, violently rouged faces, and hair made up
into teapot handles, sticking out quite six inches behind
their heads, or made into stiff wings, projecting about
three inches on either side, and always with flowers
stuck into their hair. It was hard work to avoid all
these, and to keep up with the carts, and disagreeable to
be choked and smothered in dust, and to feel oneself all
the while appearing to every one as an escaped lunatic&mdash;ploughing
through dust on one's own feet, instead
of being driven along properly. But anything was
better than jolting along that road till the great mock
fortress came into view. We were about to enter the
gates. The crowd there was too great to try to press
through; so I climbed into the cart once more, and thus
entered Peking <i>comme il faut</i>, in a springless cart.</p>

</div>

<p>It is the custom to say the road to Peking from
Tungchow is desperately uninteresting. It may be so.
I feel I ought hardly to hazard an opinion, for I was
afraid to leave my eyeglasses dangling, and thus only
once or twice managed both to get them out and up to
my eyes sufficiently steadily to see through them; but
to my shortsighted gaze there appeared to be a constant
series of interesting graves and gateways and monsters,
which I longed to examine more closely. Then the
long procession of camels carrying brick tea northwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
or coming south empty to fetch it, did not become
monotonous, even after I had seen some thousands or
more of them. The men riding upon them had handkerchiefs
tied in a very simple way, which, however,
I at once saw was the original of the old homely
English sun-bonnet. The men walking by their sides
had conical oil-paper hats, which were equally evidently
the original of the Nice hats of my youth. They had
even red linings to them, such as I had so often worn
myself in Europe, and three little spots of black, whose
nature I could not quite make out, but which on my
hats used to be represented by three little stars of
black velvet. I had always thought a Nice hat looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
Chinese, and, since I came to China, that it would be
the very thing to wear in summer; and now here
I found these camel-drivers wearing the old original
model, which probably the Jesuits carried over long
ago to North Italy.</p>

<p>The camels placed their springy hoofs softly on the
hard, stony road. Those that wore bells carried their
arched necks high. Their grave eyes looked down
kindly on the clouds of dust. Between their two humps
rode a man, as in a natural saddle. Their yellow necks
shone in the slanting rays of the sun, while the great
tufts of hair at the tops of their legs stood out darkly.
I thought I should grow tired of them, but I had not
even by the time we had reached the gate of Peking,
at the end of our long day's travel of <i>thirteen</i> miles.</p>

<p>"Is this inside the city or outside the city?" I asked
at last of my stout carter, when we seemed to have
been travelling an interminable distance through roads
rather like Clapham Common, if there were no grass
upon it, and two rows of booths cutting it into three
divisions&mdash;two of booths and one of road&mdash;so wide and
uncared for and wildernesslike was this last. "Inside
the city," answered he haughtily. I felt as if I had
been very rude to ask, and longed to apologise, if I
had hurt his feelings. But the road was so unlike a
city street. It was like a large caravanserai, or like the
encampment of a savage tribe. The shops that skirted
the road had gaily gilded fronts, and every now and
then a shopkeeper sent out men to scoop up the liquid
filth at either side, and sprinkle it upon the dust by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
way of somewhat keeping it down. The smell resulting
left nothing to be desired. Long before we reached
Peking I had decided that the Chinese were a docile,
peaceable nation of traders, overrun by a northern horde
so incurably barbarous, that not even centuries of contact
with the Chinese had been able to civilise them,
though it might have made them so effeminate that
they would soon become effete. I now began to
wonder how long Peking could go on accumulating
filth within its walls without breeding a Black Death
or other awful pestilence.</p>

<p>We drove on and on. At last we turned down
a very disreputable, dilapidated sort of mews; and
there was the French Embassy to the right, very smart
in fresh paint; the Japanese Embassy, very perky, with
a European gateway; the German Embassy, dignified
and fresh painted. Round the corner stood the English
Embassy, with a massive but somewhat jail-like portal.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages it often seems as if it must
have been very pleasant for the lords and ladies. And
in Peking it is very pleasant to live in a ducal palace.
From the moment the Embassy servant stepped forward
with a fly-flap, and courteously flapped the dust off
our boots, everything was charming. We never wished
to go outside again to face that vile mews, with its
holes, its dust, its smells. We forgot all about it,
as we looked at the stately perspective of the inner
entrance of the Palace,&mdash;its ceilings richest blue and
brilliant green, relieved by golden pomegranates and
dragons; its mortised beams projecting, all highly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
painted, green, red&mdash;green, red. Not a sound penetrated
within its sheltered courtyards. The wood-carvings
were beautiful, the galleries long enough to
satisfy all desire for walking. The Chinese decorations
satisfied our eyes. At last&mdash;at last we had come
upon something Oriental in China, æsthetic, eye-satisfying.
At the same time we were surrounded by
every English comfort, enjoying delightful English
society! Why ever go outside the Embassy compound?
Could Peking possibly have anything to show worth
encountering such horrors as those of its entry, a
survival from those Middle Ages so agreeable to read
about, so disagreeable to live in?</p>

<p>But one evening we took the one Peking walk,
along the summit of the walls. There was something
pathetic, as well as ludicrous, in thinking of European
attachés and their wives, European diplomatists and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
their families, having for a pleasure-walk the walls of
Peking. The horrors of the approach to them can
only be realised by those who know what the <i>entourage</i>
of the walls of a Chinese city is generally like. They
cannot be described in a book, that may lie on an
English drawing-room table. Arrived at the top, you
find a wilderness of thorns and plants and trees, and
there in and out amongst them a narrow way, along
which a lady can barely manage to walk without tearing
her dress. From the walls you see the yellow
roofs of the Imperial Palace buildings within the inner
wall, inside the Forbidden City. And you wonder what
it must be like to be a Chinese Emperor, brought up
under one of those yellow roofs, and never allowed
outside that Forbidden City, except for a ceremonial
visit to a temple, to pray for rain or fine weather.
You see the green-tiled roofs of the princely ducal
buildings, far more effective than the yellow by the
evening light. On the one side you look at the "Outside
City," the China town; on the other the "Inside
City," the Tartar town, where the Embassies, etc., are.
In the centre of this last, four-square, is placed the
Forbidden Imperial City. Then you look out into the
distance upon the western hills, beautiful in the sunset
light. But it is fast growing dark. As we came
out, the sun was still too hot to be pleasant. Now
already it is too dark to discern distant objects. We
turn back to that oasis in the wilderness of Peking,
that fairy palace, the Ying-kuo Fu. We reach once
more the beautiful perspective, that makes us long for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
the British Minister to stand in state with his following,
holding a reception of Chinese mandarins, that we
might see them all grouped according to their dignities
against such a picturesque background. Then looking
at the blue and green and golden dragon beams, at
the sunshine and the stillness of the courtyards, we
feel inclined, like Germans, to evolve the rest of Peking
out of our own inner consciousness. Oh, rest ye,
brother-mariners, we will not wander more!</p>

<p>The "sights" of Peking have not been on view of
late years. It seems a pity, considering how many
people have travelled thither hoping to see them.
And yet I am not sure that it is not a relief. It seems
a duty one owes oneself to go and see those one can,
and the people even at those behave with an insolence
and indecorum such as I am not quite sure if even
seeing the sight makes up for. Anyway, the Temple
of Heaven has been closed of late years&mdash;that Temple
in which to this day worship is offered by the Emperor
on behalf of his people, in accordance with a ritual
more ancient than any other still in use. The Temple
of Agriculture is closed; ditto the Clock Tower and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
the Bell Tower; ditto, they say, all that remains of
the Summer Palace. Even the Examination Hall we
could not succeed in getting into. Whilst his one
great friend advised us not to attempt the Lamaserai,
where the living Buddha in Peking resides, such a
set of rowdies are the Lamas. They demand exorbitant
sums for opening each fresh gate; they lay
forcible hands upon visitors, and finally demand what
they please for letting them out again. That very
thrilling tale of horrors "The Swallows' Wing" is only
a little heightened version of what a traveller who
went in might have to undergo. We rode up to the
gate, and the expression of the Lamas outside, who
thought we were coming in, was enough for me. I
have studied the expressions of Neapolitan priests,
but they do not compare for vileness with those of these
Lamas: the Lamas, too, look fierce&mdash;fierce, coarse, and
insolent. They of course redouble their demands and
insolence, when ladies are among the visitors. The
living Buddha himself can only be approached in the
guise of a tribute-bearer bringing offerings: a bottle
of brandy, a pound of sugar, and a tin of Huntley &amp;
Palmer's mixed biscuits, sugared, are said to be the
most acceptable. And we considered sending this
information to Messrs. Huntley &amp; Palmer for advertising
purposes. But even with the biscuits and the
brandy there has to be a good deal of arrangement, all
of which demands time. And, after all, the living
Buddha is only occasionally <i>en statue</i>; at other times
he receives like any other Tibetan. And whether one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
cares to associate with Tibetans at all, except for
missionary purposes, is a question. That Buddhism,
which with the Chinese is so pure and humane a
religion, they have transformed into something so gross,
it seems their very gods are unfit to look upon; the
God of Happy Marriage impossible to show to a lady,
as said the Russian gentleman who had made a
collection of images, Chinese, Indian, and Tibetan!
Chinese images are all fit for any one to see, as their
classics are fit for any one to read; Indian images are
questionable; but about Tibetan there seems no question
at all, and he simply asked me to advance no farther
into his museum, as my husband examined them. It
was impossible for me even then not to think that
living surrounded by those horrible emblems of divinity,
his whole drawing-room full of them, must have some
effect upon the unhappy man's character. As I stood
among them, an evil influence seemed to emanate from
them, and the subsequent career of their unhappy
collector confirms the theory; for but a few years
later he was dismissed from the Chinese Customs for
some crime too bad to mention, dying shortly afterwards.
The collection has been bought by a German
museum. Let us hope those dreadful Tibetan images
are not now poisoning the minds of blue-eyed Germans.</p>

<p>Tibetan musical instruments for sacred purposes
are made of virgins' bones (the virgins killed expressly,
we were told, but I doubt this); their sacred pledge-cups,
of human skulls. They prefer necklaces each
bead of which is made out of a tiny portion of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
human skull, thus each bone representing a human life.
Their idols are represented as wearing human skins,
with girdles hung with human heads. So much as
this I was allowed to see in this wonderful collection
of gods and praying-machines, where meekly pious
or coarsely jocund Chinese images sit cheek-by-jowl
with graceful, slender Indian deities, and cruel,
devilish Tibetan images. After all, no nation's conception
of God can be higher than the nation; but
it is at least, as a rule, supposed to be as high.
Judging them by their idols, it was better, I thought
then, to keep out of the way of Tibetan Lamas&mdash;little
thinking it was to be my good fortune in subsequent
years to penetrate into Tibet itself, nor how rudely
there I should find the Lamas treat me.</p>

<p>Even the tomb erected to the Banjin Lama at the
Hoang Ssu (Yellow Temple) repelled me, in spite of
intricate marble carvings, considered well worth the
seeing. The workmanship was good, but the outline
was simply hideous. Not even purple-blue sky, and
golden sunshine, and old fir-trees, with golden-balled
persimmons nestling beside them, relieved it from its
native ugliness. But alongside of it was a great two-storied
building in true Chinese style, that we indeed
admired. It stood four-square, with a grandly massive
<i>porte-cochère</i>, answering all the purposes of a verandah,
so vast was it. We looked at the simple, graceful
curves of its two stories of roofs, the upper definitely
but only slightly smaller than the lower, and wished
that, when it fell to our lot to own a house in China,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
it might be after this model. For two stories seem
advisable for health, and nothing could surpass in roof-grace
those grand curves, modelled, it is said, upon
the upturning boughs of forest trees, though more
probably upon the tent of former ages.</p>

<p>The Confucian Temple, where there are tablets to
Confucius and his four great followers, may be called
a satisfactory sight, and has remained open of late
years. Viewed as a picnic place, it is delightful. The
vast courts, with their old, old fir-trees, gave me far
more pleasure even than the marble balustrades, or
the ancient granite so-called drums we had gone to
see. But even there the behaviour of the people was
what anywhere else one would call insolent in the
extreme. The importunity, sores, and dirt of the
Peking gamins render them also a detestable <i>entourage</i>.
Things reached their climax, however, at the Hall
of the Classics. The open door was as usual banged
to in our faces, as we came near; and we were then
asked through the closed door how much we would
give to get in. Then as soon as we got in, all the
detestable rabble following us were let in too, much
though I begged they might be kept out. I do not
think I had up to that time seen anything so neglected
and dilapidated as the Hall of the Classics, the building
in all China which one would most expect to see
kept in good order, nothing being so much esteemed
in China as learning, and especially the learning of
the ancients. Some workmen, with almost no clothing,
were apparently employed in making it dirtier; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
directly we entered they left off doing whatever it was,
and devoted themselves to horse-play of the coarsest
description, standing upright on their hands, pirouetting
their feet over the heads of the crowd who came in
with us, knocking some of them down, and rolling them
in the dust. They even went so far as to sit down
in their more than semi-nude condition on the same
bench on which I was sitting, and as near me as
possible; whilst all the while there was such a shouting
and noise, it was impossible for my husband and
me to speak to one another.</p>

<p>It is all very well to remind oneself one is in the
presence of a great work, and to try and feast one's
soul upon proportions and perspectives in the presence
of such lewd behaviour of people of the baser sort.
To put it prettily, I was distracted by a great pity for
people whose chances in life seemed to have been so
small; in plainer English, my temper began to rise.
The porcelain arch we had come to see was certainly
beautiful, a masterpiece, but not soul-satisfying. We
duly noticed the elaborate eaves, protected by netting
from the birds. But then came the usual question:
How much would we pay to get out? They locked
the door in our faces, demanding more money before
they would let us out. My husband could stand no
more. He was just recovering from a dangerous
illness; but he took up a big beam, and smashed
open the door. It fell, lintel and all, and the latter
so nearly killed a child in its fall the crowd was
awed. This just gave us time to get on our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
donkeys. Then Babel broke loose again, and the
storm continued till we had ridden half an hour away,
our donkey-men nearly indulging in a stand-up fight
in the end, one of them brandishing at the other a
very gracefully carved sceptre, that I had just picked
up at a fair, to my intense delight. "A nice fellow
you are," shouted one to the other. "You ate up all
the biscuits, and now you don't know the road. You
are worth nothing at all." So that was the way the
biscuits had disappeared: the donkey-men had levied
toll on our luncheons, and we had suspected the
Peking gamins. As there are other porcelain arches
in Peking, it might be as well for other visitors to
avoid the Hall of the Classics altogether, we thought.</p>

<p>It is horrible to write expressing so much dissatisfaction
in the presence of the far-famed masterpieces
of a great empire, and the more so as we were very
sorry to be leaving Peking, and should much have
liked to spend a winter there, studying it all more
thoroughly. But Sir Harry Parkes, when he came
back to it, said it was returning to "Dirt! Dust! and
Disdain!" and the only objection the passing traveller
would be likely to make to this sentence is that it
might contain a few more D's.</p>

<p>The Observatory is a delightful sight&mdash;always barring
the behaviour of the custodian, the most loathsome
wretch I had yet encountered. And he wanted to
feel me all over; did feel all over the Legation
Secretary who kindly accompanied us, finally ransacking
his pockets for more money than he had thought needful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
to bestow upon him. The weird, writhing bronze stands
of the old instruments, with their redundancy of carving,
will be for ever imprinted on my brain. Both those
that stand below in a neglected courtyard, and those
high above the wall, standing out against the sky,
commanding the great granaries and the lovely mountains
of the west, with the whole city of Peking lying
in between, its courtyards filled with fine trees, giving
the whole the aspect of a vast park rather than a
populous city&mdash;all are beautiful. These wonderful instruments
were made under the instructions of the old
Jesuits, who so nearly won China to Christianity (would
have done so, probably, but for the jealousy of the other
religious orders), and who were for years the guides
and counsellors of the Chinese Emperors. As to the
outside of the pavilions within the Forbidden City, all
one was allowed to see of them then, the glittering
yellow Imperial roofs are like my childish idea of a
fairy palace. There they stand upon their hills, dotted
about among the trees, so glittering and graceful, I
thought I should never tire of riding past the Green
Hill, across the Marble Bridge.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Fathers, who have for centuries
lived under the shadow of the Imperial Palace,
were having then to turn out before the New Year,
as also the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul, with their
innumerable foundling children. For it was said that
the Empress herself intended to reside in the Fathers'
European house. It was she who originally so objected
to the high towers of the church, as destructive of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
<i>Fung shui</i>. Then she was saying she observed ever
since they were built she had been particularly fortunate,
and she begged that church and towers and organ might
be handed to her intact, together with Père Armand
David's valuable collection of birds. Fortunately, there
are counterparts of these in Paris, for it was feared she
might give one specimen to one favoured courtier and
one to another, and thus destroy the whole value of
the collection. For the shrewd Father, observing the
extraordinary pride of the Chinese heart, beside their
own somewhat demure-coloured birds and butterflies,
had placed a collection of the most gorgeous specimens
from Brazil and Java, that he might say drily, when
showing Chinese officials round, "See how favoured
are the other nations of the earth!" From the towers
the Empress may possibly intend to look down upon
the Palace garden, as no one hitherto has been allowed
to do. For the Fathers were only allowed to retain
their cathedral on condition that no one ever mounted
the towers, from which a bird's-eye view can be
obtained of nearly the whole Palace garden. The
church, it was then announced, she would use as an
audience hall, and, it was added, receive foreigners
in it. But such great changes as this have not yet
come about in Peking. No people better than Chinese
understand saying they will do a thing, and yet not
doing it.</p>

<p>But, whatever happens in it, Peking, as long as it
exists, can never lose its character of a great caravanserai,
in which one is always coming upon the unexpected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
For instance, a Red Button's funeral, as we saw it one
day, with about a hundred of the greatest ruffians,
misshapen, patched, tattered or naked, hideous, yet
rejoicing in being employed, each with a long red
feather stuck strangely upright in the oldest-looking
Jim Crow sort of felt hat, carrying a banneret or a
parasol; the red chair of the official carried aloft; then
afterwards paper images of his wives, etc.! Or, if not
a dignitary's funeral, one comes across a bird market,
every man with a well-trained, red-throated bird sitting
on a stick, crooked like a magnified note of interrogation,
or a hooded hawk. Then a street row&mdash;filth unutterable!
Perhaps a hundred camels sitting in little rings round
their baggage, and not obstructing traffic in the least;
elegant curios laid out in the dust of the street for
sale; three carts all at once stuck in the same rut,
all their horses and mules resting, panting, after vain
efforts to get them out; Manchu women, with natural
feet, very long silk gowns of the most villainously
tawdry hue; or mandarins in exquisitely coloured silks,
with only two wheels to their carts, and those far
behind it, so as to indicate their dignity, twenty gaily
clad retainers trotting after them on ponies! At one
moment squalor and filth, such as to make one think
of St. Giles's as cleanly by comparison; at the next or
at the same moment gorgeous shop-fronts, all of the
finest carving, with most brilliant gilding.</p>

<p>But of all the sights on view in Peking, the finest
sight to my mind was the British Legation&mdash;a grand
old Chinese palace, at that time perfectly kept up, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
gorgeous in colouring, deepest blue, pure green, golden-dragoned,
and lighted up with vermilion touches.
Whether one looked at the mortised beams, projecting
outside as well as inside, and thus forming the most
complex, highly coloured eaves, or at the decorated
beams in the reception-rooms, each one a revelation
of colour to a London art-decorator, the eye was alike
perfectly satisfied. And at that time, owing to the
exquisite taste of the then British Minister's wife, as
also probably to the liberality of Sir John Walsham
himself, the decorations of the Embassy thoroughly
harmonised with its architecture and colouring. If
Peking outside was an embarrassment of D's, the
Legation was then all cleanliness, comfort, and charm.</p>

<p>One cannot help reflecting sadly on what an object-lesson
the capital conveys to all the innumerable
officials who have to travel thither, as also to the
crowds of young men who go there year after year
to compete for the highest honour to be obtained by
competition&mdash;admission to the Hanlin College. When
the distances are considered in an empire about as
big as Europe, and also the difficulties of travel in a
country without roads and without railways, it is the
more astonishing this custom was ever started and can
still be kept up. Each expectant is mulcted in a heavy
sum, as bribes to the officials about the Palace. Thus
the rabble of Peking live by tribute from the whole
empire. And so rooted is the custom, even the
gatekeeper at the British Legation would demand his
toll, whilst the sums that have been paid to get into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
the Imperial Palace often run into six figures. And all
who come to Peking know how things are administered
there by bribery and corruption, and see for themselves
that nothing there is cleaned, nothing ever put in order.
As Sir Robert Hart himself says, but for the clouds
of dust continually kept in movement by the winds,
and brought in from the ever-increasingly impoverished
country round, they must have been all dead men in
Peking long ago. The dust serves as a great disinfectant,
whilst it so permeates all clothing worn there,
that no dress in which one has once gone out in
Peking seems fit ever to put on again for any other
purpose.</p>

<p>Peking is probably the only large city in the whole
world where no arrangements whatever are made for
sanitation or even for common decency. The result is
alike startling and disgusting to the traveller. But on
inquiry it becomes even worse. There were drains&mdash;sewers&mdash;in
the time of the Ming Emperors, and it is
now the duty of a special official to report upon their
condition every year, and see that they are kept in
order. But the drains are all closed up; and though a
boy in peculiar clothing is let down into them each year,
as it were at one end, it is another boy, though in
the same peculiar clothing, who is taken out at the
other end.</p>

<p class="caption">MOUNTAIN VILLAGE, WITH SHAM BEACON FIRES TO LEFT,

<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>China is the land of shams and middle-men, and
the official from the country sees all this, and, sore
with the undue lightening of his own purse, goes home,
having learnt his lesson to exact bribes himself, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
himself rest satisfied with shams, and report all in order,
when he knows that it is not so. Far from feeling
ashamed of the state the roads in his own province have
got into, he remembers those of Peking, that are so
much worse. Indeed, through all the country, since
the incoming of the Manchu Dynasty, it has been the
deliberate official intention to neglect the roads, thus
making it the more difficult for the people to assemble
together and revolt against their alien rulers. Probably,
too, he sees the Tsung-li Yamen, the office created of
late years in order to transact business with European
nations. Tsung-li Yamen sounds well, but the building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
is a dirty, dilapidated shed, that might pass muster for
a cowhouse on an English gentleman's estate, <i>if</i> it were
cleaned and fresh painted. To the Chinese mind this
building being set apart to hold interviews with the
representatives of Foreign Powers sufficiently indicates
in what esteem they are held by his Government, and
what amount of courtesy he is intended to mete out
to them.</p>

<p>The foreigner, on the other hand, travels away, having
learnt his lesson too, if he be of a reflective mind, and
that is, very briefly, that there is no hope for China
under the present dynasty. The Manchus may have
been a very fine people when they first entered China;
but since then they have lived <i>like gentlemen</i>, according
to the common saying, not earning their living, but as
pensioners of the State, nominally ready to be called
out to fight, if wanted, in time of war. They do not
enter into business, they do not study, and they have
lost their martial qualities and become as effeminate as
Chinamen. The Chinese Empire has been decaying
ever since it came into their hands; and ever since I
have known China the Chinese have been saying the
Manchu Dynasty has ruled its appointed number of
years, and that it is now high time for what they
call a Saviour of Society to appear, as so often in
the past.</p>

<p>This Saviour of Society would probably have appeared
long ago, but for the help the nations of Europe, and
especially England, have given towards the centralisation
of China. In the old days it is true the Viceroys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
were appointed from Peking; but each Viceroy ruled
pretty well as he pleased in his own province, with his
own exchequer, his own army, and his own navy. We
found it inconvenient to deal with so heterogeneous a
mass without any definite head, and threw our weight
into the scale of the Chinese Empire. First we helped
to crush the Taiping rebellion, which but for our
intervention would probably have succeeded, and by
force have made the Chinese people at least nominal
Christians. Then through Sir Robert Hart the different
Viceroys have been impoverished; the money that in
former times would have gone to their private purses
or to the administration of their provinces has been
diverted to Peking. The theory was that it would be
used for the good of the nation. But probably we shall
some day know how much the Empress has used for
her private pleasures, according to the recent indictment
of her by the one great incorruptible Viceroy, Chang-chih-tung,
and how much has been absorbed by Li
Hung-chang, and all the army of Palace eunuchs and
hangers-on.</p>

<p>The Chinese are a people of traders, and patient;
they look on, and say mentally, "No belong my pigeon,"
that is, "Politics are not my business." But they
dislike the Empress; they know the young Emperor
has been used merely as a puppet; and as to the idea
of a Chinese Empire, it is one that has never made its
way into their heads. And thus it is a grave question,
when in the last Chino-Japanese war all the great
Yangtse was a moving procession of junks piled high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
with human braves, their pigtails coiled about their
heads, and their black head kerchiefs giving them
somewhat a piratical air, whether these men of Hunan
ever meant to fight the Japanese. They would have
been ready enough to fight the men of Anhui; and
when the European settlement of Shanghai found itself
between a regiment of either force, the position was
so evidently critical, that very urgent remonstrances
had to be addressed to the Chinese authorities to move
away either one force or the other. But the Hunan
men never fought the Japanese, and it remains a
question whether they ever intended doing so.</p>

<p>Even the passing foreigner must feel at Peking
that it is not the throbbing heart of a great country,
as London is, as Paris is; but the remains of the
magnificent camp of a nomad race, that has settled
down, and built in stone after the fashion in which in
its wanderings it used to build in wood.

<p>Almost all we can know of the Emperor of China
is by hearsay. He lives in his Palace inside
the Forbidden City, which again is inside the Manchu
City, separated from the Chinese City, where are the
lovely, gilded curio shops. When he goes abroad,
which he never does, except to worship at the temples,
all the people are ordered to keep within-doors, and
the most any outsider can do is to peep at him
through the crack of a door or from behind a curtain.
But as I think some details of his State may be interesting
to the general reader, and indeed would well
repay thinking over, I have extracted an abridged
translation from a Chinese newspaper's account of the
present Emperor Kwang-shü's visit to the Temple of
Heaven in 1888, when, it must be remembered, he
was only a boy between sixteen and seventeen. Those
who do not care for the accounts of pageants can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
easily skip it. Those who read it will, however, learn
much of Chinese usage therefrom, and will perhaps
better realise how remarkable must be the character
of the lad who, brought up from the age of four as
the central figure in such ceremonies, yet dared to
place himself at the head of the party of progress,
and to introduce innovations. People in England,
angry with him for being overcome, think he must
be a young man of weak character. But contrast him
with one of our European princes, read what he has
attempted, which I hope to describe in a following
chapter, and then decide which is the stronger character.
Kwang-shü has always been of weak physique&mdash;not
unnaturally, considering that he has never known
what it is to go out into the country, and take free,
healthy exercise. But probably this has been his salvation.
Had he been a young man of strong physique,
he could never, probably, have withstood the promptings
of his own nature, together with those temptations of
wine and women, by which he has been surrounded
from his earliest years. That he should not have
taken proper precautions for his own protection and
that of his supporters is hardly wonderful, considering
that from babyhood he has been treated as too
august a personage even to be seen. Probably he
had learnt to believe his will was law, and must be
executed. It is little wonder if he now looks ill and
his wife sorrowful, even if the suspicions of poison
be unfounded.</p>

<p>"On February 20th, 1888, the Emperor of China
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
went in person to the Temple of Heaven to pray for
the harvest, with the usual ceremonies. The day before
his Majesty passed in the Hall of Abstinence, in
prayer, fasting, and meditation.</p>

<p>"On February 19th, at the fifth drum (the fifth
watch, before daylight), the T`ai Ch`ang Sze (a high
bureau entrusted with the arrangement of such ceremonials)
placed a Yellow Table (the Imperial colour)
in the Hall of Great Harmony, the T`ai-hwo Tien.
South of the Emperor's seat was placed an incense-burner,
shaped like a small pavilion; and in another
similar erection, east of the left-hand pillars, stood a
scroll, on which a sentence of prayer was painted in
the choicest caligraphy. To the west of the right-hand
pillars of the building stood yet another pavilion, to
contain the mounted rolls of silk, which were painted
with similar inscriptions. The Masters of Rites and
the Readers of Prayers stood respectfully waiting outside
the gate of the Hall of Great Harmony, holding in
front of them the silken scrolls in baskets and the
incense in bronze censers.</p>

<p>"The Chief of the Ceremonial Bureau, already mentioned,
called by Mr. Mayers the Court of Sacrificial
Worship, accompanied by other officers of the Bureau,
was waiting inside the Hall; and when the time arrived,
he proceeded, with the Imperial Astronomer, to the
Gate of Pure Heaven, to announce to the Emperor
that it was two quarters of the Hour of the Hare
(<i>i.e.</i> 6.30 a.m.), and his Majesty issued from the above-named
gate, riding in a sedan-chair, passed through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
the back left gate, and thus to the Hall of Great
Harmony, where his sedan-chair was deposited at the
northern steps, and he entered the building and stood
in front of the left pillars, facing the west.</p>

<p>"Four officials of the Hanlin, or Imperial Academy
of Literature, were standing outside the right-hand door
of the building, facing east. The Readers of Prayers
now issued from the inner cabinet, holding in front
of them, respectfully elevated, prayers written on scrolls
of paper, and entered the middle gate of the Hall of
Great Harmony, the silken scrolls and incense being
borne after them into the Hall. In front of them
were borne a pair of incense-burners. The Masters
of Rites, ten in number, conducted them, preceding
them, and mounted the central steps as far as to the
Vermilion Dais. The Readers of Prayers, those who
bore the prayer-scrolls, and the bearers of silken
scrolls and incense, having entered the central gate
of the Hall, reverently laid down their burdens one
by one on the Yellow Table, and retired after three
<i>k`otows</i> (prostrations), touching the ground with the
forehead.</p>

<p>"The Chief of the Court of Sacrifice then opened
a prayer-scroll, and the Master of Rites spread a cushion
on the ground. The Emperor advanced in front of
the Yellow Table, and reverentially inspected the objects
lying on it, after which he performed the genuflection
called 'once kneel and thrice <i>k´otow</i>,' and then took
up his position again, standing as before. The Chief
of the Court of Sacrifice rolled up the prayer-scroll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
again, and the cushion on which the Emperor had just
knelt was removed.</p>

<p>"The Readers of Prayers now advanced to the
Yellow Table, and made three <i>k´otows</i>. They respectfully
took from the table and bore aloft the prayer-scrolls,
the silken scrolls, and the incense, which they
deposited one by one in the graceful pavilionlike
stand meant to receive them. With three more <i>k´otows</i>,
they retired.</p>

<p>"The mandarin in charge of the incense now carried
a box full of incense to the incense-stand, placed it
gently there, and withdrew.</p>

<p>"The bearers of the prayer-scrolls then left the edifice
by the central door, the stand containing the incense
preceding them, and that which contains the silken
scrolls following behind. The Chief of the Court of
Sacrifice, kneeling, informed the Emperor that this part
of the solemn rite was over.</p>

<p>"His Majesty mounted his sedan-chair again, and
returned to the Palace.</p>

<p>"The clock struck 9 a.m., and the Emperor, in dragon
robe and a cap of ermine surmounted by a knob of
crimson velvet, issued from the Palace gate called the
Pure Heaven Gate, seated in a summer chair borne by
eight men. Passing successively through the back left
gate, the centre left gate, and the Gate of Great
Harmony, he arrived at the Mid-day Gate, where he
descended from his sedan-chair, and ascended his great
jade palanquin, borne on the shoulders of thirty-two
men. As he mounted, the equerries-in-waiting held a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
vermilion ladder or flight of steps, leading up to the
palanquin, to assist him in getting in. All the bearers
were dressed in outer robes of red silk and inner robes
of ash-coloured linen. On their feet were fast-walking
boots of the same grey material, with thin soles, the
upper part round the ankles being of black fur. They
wore caps of leopard-skins, dappled as if with coins of
gold, with red velvet plumes, kept in position by gold
filigree plates, from which floated yellow feathers down
their backs. The palanquin is eight feet high, and
weighs about 1 ton 16 cwt.; but the bearers walked
swiftly under its weight, like lightning-flashes or shooting
stars rushing across the sky, and at every five
hundred yards they were relieved by a fresh set of
thirty-two men.</p>

<p>"When the Emperor ascended the great jade palanquin,
the sedan with its eight bearers still followed him.
Beside the palanquin walked two of the Chief Equerries
to support it.</p>

<p>"Ahead of this stately procession rolled the five
gigantic cars, ordinarily drawn by elephants, which
animals were this year absent from the fête by permission
of the Emperor, to whom the danger of their
suddenly getting ungovernable had been pointed out.</p>

<p>"Behind the Imperial palanquin were marching ten
men armed with spears hung with leopards' tails, ten
men with swords, and a dozen men carrying bows and
arrows, all representatives of the Tartar corps of the
Body-guard.</p>

<p>"Behind them came walking about a hundred of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
highest Manchu nobility, Princes, Emirs, sons of Emirs,
Dukes, Marquises, and Earls, Assistant Chamberlains
(who command in turn the Palace Guard), General Officers
of the Brigade of Imperial Guards, the Comptroller of
the Household, and the Prince of the Imperial blood
who, as President of the Clan Court, preserves the
Genealogical Record or Family Roll of the Ta Tsing
Dynasty, all armed either with bows and arrows or
with large swords. As soon as this noble company
arrived outside of the Middle Gate, they all mounted
their chargers, having before that been obliged to walk
on foot.</p>

<p>"The rear was brought up by two Assistant
Chamberlains, with their suite, bearing two immense
yellow dragon standards.</p>

<p>"Outside the Mid-day Gate were kneeling a great
number of civil and military mandarins in Court dresses,
who may not accompany the procession, being not of
sufficiently high rank, and so pay their respects to it
thus as it defiles past.</p>

<p>"The stone road to the Temple of Heaven, which is
about two and a half miles long, although not yet mended
with stones as intended, looked neat, with all its inequalities
hidden under a uniform covering of yellow
soil. At the mouth of every road or street, whether
within the wall of Peking or outside it, which ran into
the route of the procession at right angles to its course,
were mat sheds, draped outside with blue cloth, serving
as tents for Chinese infantry (Green Standard), who
mounted guard at each corner, armed with whips, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
keep order and silence amongst the people in these
streets. At every five paces of the road along which
the procession passed stood a guardsman of the
vanguard, in full uniform, sword by his side and whip
in hand. The gates and doors of every house and
shop were closed, and red silk decorations hung in
festoons in front of them, all along the route; and
in front of every sentry station were displayed bows
and arrows, swords and spears, arranged in symmetrical
order, with decorative lanterns and satin hangings.
The Emperor, having arrived at the left gate of the
brick wall of the Temple, exchanged his great jade
palanquin for a sedan-chair with eight bearers only,
and, on entering the west side of the sacred path inside
the Left Gate of Prayers for the Year, descended, and
on foot walked up to the Chamber of Imperial Heaven,
holding a stick of incense burning in his hand in the
prescribed manner, after which he inspected the victims
(oxen, etc.) laid out there, the sacrificial vessels of
bamboo and wood, and, returning to the west side of
the sacred road, got into his sedan-chair again, went
out at the Gate of Prayers for the Year, and repaired
to the Hall of Abstinence, to pass a season in holy
contemplation in the Immeasurable Chamber.</p>

<p>"The duty of patrolling the Temple of Heaven, etc.,
devolves upon the Princes of the Blood on these
occasions. But Princes descended from chiefs of the
Manchu Dynasty before their conquest of China,
accompanied by the Emperor's aide-de-camp, the Chief
of the Eunuchs, and other officers, kept patrol outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
the apartment, when the Emperor, in the Immeasurable
Chamber of his Hall of Abstinence, at four o'clock in
the morning, commanded supper, which was duly served
by the gentlemen-in-waiting, whilst the bronze statue
bearing on its head the inscription 'Abstinence'
was set up, fronting his Majesty as he sat.</p>

<p>"The Chief of the Court of Sacrifice, already mentioned,
had arranged a prayer-mat on the ground outside
the Chamber of Prayers for the Year, and had
set up the Tablet of Shang Ti (the Supreme God) in
the interior of the Chamber, facing south, with, on the
right and left, the Tablets of the Emperor's Ancestors,
facing east and west respectively. A great curtain had
been hung up outside the door of the Chamber.</p>

<p>"The Emperor, in his sacrificial vestments embroidered
with the golden dragon, a Court cap of white
ermine on his head, surmounted with an immense pearl
set in a gold ornament representing nine dragons, and
a necklace of one hundred and eight precious pearls
round his neck, issued from the Hall of Abstinence
at the appointed hour, riding in a summer sedan-chair
borne by eight men, entered the Temple, and reached
the Left Gate of Prayers for the Year through the
west gate of the brick wall of the Temple. Here
alighting, he walked into the Chamber of Prayers for
the Year, and adored Shang Ti (Supreme Ruler) and
his own august ancestors. The animal victims and the
sacrificial vessels of various sorts were here already laid
out in the prescribed order.</p>

<p>"The Reader of Prayers knelt in front of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
Majesty, holding up the prayer-scroll in both hands,
and reverentially recited the prayer. As it was still
dark inside the building, another official of the Court
of Sacrifice knelt beside him with a candle to throw
a clear light on the written words of the prayer. When
the prayer had been read, the Emperor knelt three
times, nine times <i>k`otowing</i>, then rose again to his feet.
The incense-bearer brought the incense, the winecup-bearer
brought the cup, the silk-bearer the silk, and
the official with the cushion spread it on the floor.
The Master of the Ceremonies then ushered his
Majesty to his place. The Emperor knelt again thrice,
and <i>k`otowed</i> nine times, and when he rose again the
musicians played three antique airs.</p>

<p>"The paper ingots and the offerings of food from
the carcases of the animal victims were held up and
presented, as prescribed by ancient forms. Officers of
the Board of Ceremonies, of the Court of Sacrificial
Worship, and of the Court of Imperial Entertainments,
holding respectively in both hands the prayer-scroll,
the silken prayer-scrolls, and the incense-case, advanced
to the great incense-burner, and solemnly burned all
these objects to ashes. The Chief of the Court of
Sacrificial Worship then knelt, and announced to the
Emperor that the ceremony was finished.</p>

<p>"His Majesty, ascending the summer sedan-chair,
returned to his chamber in the Hall of Abstinence, to
change his attire and have some repose. Then getting
into his palanquin again, he was carried through the
inner and the outer gates of the Temple, the State
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
musicians performing an ancient melody. The <i>cortège</i>,
in the same order as before, passed through the Cheng
Yang Gate, and the Emperor burned incense in the
Buddhist Temple and the Temple of Kwan Ti (the God
of War). There
Taoist priests in
full attire knelt
to receive him
at the left of the
entrance. When
this ceremony
was finished, the
Emperor passed
through the Ta
Tsing Gate, the
music ceasing as
the bell tolled
out from over
the Mid-day
Gate. Passing
through the
T`ien Ngan
Gate, the Tuan
Gate, the Mid-day and the T`ai Hwo Gates, and the
Chien Tsing Gate, he returned to his Palace in Peking,
and the procession dispersed.</p>

<p>"The Emperor entered the Palace, paid his respects
to the aged Empress, and went to his Cabinet.</p>

<p>"The knowledge that our Emperor thus worships
the gods and reveres his ancestors so devoutly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
prays for the people that they may be fed and clothed,
well protected, and happy all over the land, must
surely fill us with loyalty and admiration for his august
person."</p>

</div>

<p>On March 2nd of the same year it is recorded that
"the Emperor went at 2.20 p.m. in a sedan-chair to
the Pavilion of Purple Light, where, seated under a
yellow silken canopy, he enjoyed the sight of the
Mongol Princes partaking of the banquet which had
been laid out for them by his orders, including milk-wine
(<i>koumis</i>) and milk-tea. Eight champion wrestlers
then had a few bouts at this sport, the winners obtaining
prizes of silk and meats and wine. The soldiers'
trained horses and camels then were put through some
circus tricks, and there was fencing with sword and
spear. After this the visitors were entertained with
Mahomedan songs by the Mahomedan camp, and with
an exhibition of pole-climbing and tightrope-walking,
music by a trained band, horseraces, and singing-boys,
concluding with a fine display of fireworks. The
Mongol Princes, rising from their places at the end,
respectfully thanked his Majesty for his kindness to
them, and the Emperor returned to his Palace in his
chair at about a quarter to five.</p>

<p>"When the Mongol Princes come to Court at Peking
from their country every year, they are presented by
the Emperor with several hundreds of rolls of silk, and
also with a sum of about £685 for travelling expenses,
issued from the Board of Revenue through the Colonial
Office. In case the Board of Revenue does not issue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
this money in time for the strangers to receive it
before they start, the Colonial Office is empowered to
issue it in advance, sending in an account to the Board
of how it was distributed, as a mark of consideration
for men from afar."</p>

<p>In 1891 a Chinese paper gives us a list of the
china sent from the great porcelain works at King-teh-chen,
near Kiukiang, for the Imperial household: "The
usual supply for the year comprised 80 pieces of
the finest quality and 1,204 round articles of a high-class
kind. In addition to this there was a special
indent for 1,414 plates, dishes, cups, and vases, to be
distributed as presents on the occasion of the Emperor's
birthday. The total cost amounted to £4,000; and
as the yearly allowance is £1,500, there is a debit
balance of £2,500, which will be deducted from the
surplus remaining over from previous years."</p>

<p>In 1890 the <i>Peking Gazette</i> tells us that "Yu Hsiu,
the director of the Imperial silk factories at Nanking,
etc., applies for an extension of the time originally
allowed him wherein to execute a special order for
certain goods which the Emperor intends to distribute
as presents. He states that in the eighth moon he
received an order through the Office of Supernumeraries
for embroidered robes, large and small rolls of
satin and silk gauze, amounting in all to 4,183 pieces,
to be ready for delivery in two months' time. As
these are intended for presents, he naturally must
devote all his time and attention thereto, and endeavour
to have them ready as soon as possible; but he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
point out that, of the embroidered robes, there are 210
requiring very careful fine work, and of the other articles
3,970 pieces of different patterns, forming a very large
total, to complete which his machinery is inadequate.
Under these circumstances, and considering that the
appointed time for delivery is close at hand, he is afraid
he will be unable to execute the order by the end of
the tenth moon.</p>

<p>"The necessary funds for carrying on the work he
estimates at £19,500, and he will, in concert with
the Governor of the province, take measures to have
this amount collected as soon as possible. He proposes,
in the first instance, to raise the sum of £10,000, and
at once set to work on the ceremonial robes; and
some of the satin, together with the silk, he hopes to
be able to deliver within the year as a first instalment.
The remainder of the order he trusts will be ready
by the spring. By this means he will have adequate
funds to carry on the work as required, and greater
care can be devoted to the finish of the various articles.
As, however, he dare not do this on his own responsibility,
he would ask the Imperial sanction to execute
the order in the manner proposed.&mdash;<i>Granted. Let the
Yamen concerned take note.</i>"</p>

<p>In 1891 it is again the <i>Peking Gazette</i> that tells us on
May 1st: "Of the one hundred and thirteen Manchu
ladies presented to the Empress-Dowager to be selected
as maids of honour, thirty-three were chosen and distributed
about the Palace to learn their duties. Thirty
were ordered to be placed on the list of expectants.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
The rest were sent back to their families, carrying
with them gifts of much value."</p>

<p>Again the <i>Peking Gazette</i> tells us in 1891: "It is
a long-standing custom of China in the spring of each
year for the Emperor to perform the ceremony of
offering a sacrifice to the Patron Saint of Agriculture,
and for the Empress to offer a similar one to the Patron
Saint of Silkworms. By these means it is intended to
encourage agriculture and sericulture in the empire.
The first sacrifice to the Patron Saint of Agriculture
since the death of the Emperor Tung Chih was offered
last spring by the present Emperor, who had not until
that time taken over the reins of government. The
fourth day of the third moon of the present year was
appointed for offering a sacrifice to the Patron Saint
of Sericulture. As her Majesty was wearing mourning
for the late Prince Ch`ün, two maids of honour of the
first grade were ordered to act on her behalf."</p>

<p>Prince Ch`ün was the father of the Emperor, a
man held in high esteem; and of him the <i>Peking Gazette</i>
says in 1891: "His innate humility and modesty made
him receive such favours with ever-increasing awe and
respect. He never once availed himself of the privilege
which we granted him of using an apricot-yellow chair
and, quoting the precedent established in the case of
the Palace of Perpetual Harmony, he reverentially
begged that his Palace, which had the good fortune to
be the birthplace of an Emperor, should be reclaimed
by the State."</p>

<p>In the photographs extant it may be noticed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
youthful Emperor greatly resembles his father in
appearance.</p>

<p>As giving a little further insight into the mediæval
usages still observed in the Court at Peking, it may
be interesting to notice that in 1891, "after the Clear-Bright
Festival, the Court of Feasting, in accordance
with the usual custom, presented forty different kinds of
vegetables, such as cucumbers, French beans, cabbages,
etc., to the Throne, for the use of the Imperial
tables"; whilst the following extracts from different
Chinese newspapers show some of the troubles of the
Palace.</p>

<p>In 1891 the <i>Hupao</i> records: "The Imperial hunting
preserves are outside the Yungting Gate of Peking.
The park is twelve miles in extent, and contains trees
of great size, hundreds of years old. It is stocked
with wild animals of varied descriptions; predominating
among them is the red-deer. As for the last twenty
years no hunt has been organised [poor young Emperor
never allowed to go out!], the game have greatly increased
in numbers. The soldiers who keep guard
over the place daily poach on the preserves, and of
late the inhabitants round about the place have
managed somehow to get within the walls and trap
the deer. The market is full of red-deer meat, which
the dealers term donkey flesh or beef, to evade
inquiries on the part of the police. The authorities
have finally got wind of the matter, and by strict
watching caught three poachers, who have been handed
over to the Board of Punishments. The guards have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
received a severe reprimand and stringent orders to
prevent further poaching."</p>

<p>In old days the Manchus were a great hunting
race, but they seem to have lost all manliness, all the
men now vegetating upon the pensions assigned them
since the conquest of China. But the Empress-Dowager,
whom Chang-chih-tung, the incorruptible
Viceroy of Hupeh, has openly accused of intercepting
and appropriating to her own uses the money voted for
the army and navy, continues to enjoy herself. And
again a Chinese newspaper records: "The Empress-Dowager
lately paid a visit to the garden built for
her by the present Emperor, and took a trip on
the Kun-ming Lake in a steam-launch." Whilst the
<i>Shenpao</i> relates: "More than twenty large firms have
taken over contracts for finishing the Eho Palace
gardens, which have been built by the Emperor as a
place of recreation for the Empress-Dowager, after her
retirement from managing the arduous affairs of State.
Her Majesty prefers to visit and stay in them during
the summer, and the time appointed to have the gardens
in a complete state for her reception is very near.
More than ten thousand workmen have been engaged
to hasten the work. Of these, three thousand or more
are carvers, who have caused much trouble while
working in other portions of the Imperial Palace ere
this. Knowing that the date for completing the gardens
was near at hand, they struck for higher wages, and
in this demand all the carpenters joined. They were
receiving individually three meals and about eightpence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
per diem. They demanded half a crown a day. On
their employers refusing to comply with this exorbitant
request, a signal gun, previously agreed upon, was fired,
and thousands of workmen, carvers, carpenters, and
masons began to make threatening demonstrations.
The officials on guard, finding the police unable to
cope with the multitude, especially as the carpenters
were armed with axes, quickly sounded the alarm,
calling on the rifle brigade, Yuen-ming-yuen guards,
and cavalry for assistance. These came with all speed
and surrounded the strikers. The officials and the
head firms now began to negotiate, and all parties were
satisfied with an increase of 8<i>d.</i> a day for each man."</p>

<p>Strikes and riots, indeed, it seems of late years
have not been infrequent in Peking; and this account
of Tientsin workmen may well follow here, as showing
what has to be contended with:</p>

<p>"The Tientsin workmen engaged in the manufacture
of iron rice-pans are, as a rule, desperate and lawless
characters. They are divided into clans, and fighting
seems to be their only pastime. When a row or a
fire occurs, they are the first to be on the spot,
quarrelling and fighting. Laws are inadequate to restrain
them. Their motto is 'Death before cowardice,' and
to their credit it must be said that even under the
most harrowing tortures none of them have ever been
known to cry for mercy. Any one showing weakness
under physical suffering is boycotted by the rest of
the gang; and he being a rowdy, and knowing no better,
feels abjectly humiliated thereby, and considers life but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
a void when burdened by the curses of his sworn
brethren. The authorities take great pains in putting
down such lawlessness, but their efforts so far have
not resulted in much success, as will be seen from the
following occurrence. Some time during last winter a
quarrel broke out between the patrolmen on one side
and the rice-pan workmen on the other or east side
of the river. The quarrel did not at first produce a
fight, but sowed the seeds of hatred and thought of
vengeance on the part of the rowdies. The New
Year festivities seemed to reconcile all parties; but
soon mistrust and suspicion again revived, and both
sides prepared for battle. Great vigilance was observed,
and they slept, as it were, with swords and spears
ready by their sides. Such a state of things could
not continue long. About a week ago, one cold and
stormy night, about twelve o'clock, a band of rowdies
five hundred strong, fully equipped, marched by stealth
to the quarters of the guards, who were then all out
on duty. The rowdies had the whole place to themselves.
They tore down the barracks, seized the
arms, and destroyed all personal effects. Leaving ruin
and devastation in their wake, they turned their steps
homewards, but were pursued and overtaken by the
guards, who gathered to the number of several hundreds.
A skirmish followed, resulting in the utter rout of the
rowdies. Two of them were captured and several
were wounded. The guards suffered also to some
extent. When the soldiers from the garrison camps
came upon the scene, both parties had disappeared."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span></p>

<p>The Tientsin men throughout the empire are known
as rowdies, but the rowdies of the streets of Peking
(possibly originally from Tientsin) are certainly the worst.</p>

<p>There are only two other men, who can be compared
in position with the Emperor of China. One
is the Emperor of Russia, also now a young man;
the other is the Dalai Lama, popularly reputed to be
never allowed to live beyond a certain very youthful
age. The <i>Peking Gazette</i> of July 5th, 1891, says:
"Sheng-tai, the Resident in Tibet, reports the fact
that on the fifth day of the first moon of the present
year the Dalai Lama did, in accordance with immemorial
usage, descend from the mountain, and, accompanied
by a large body of priests, proceed to the great shrine
and offer up prayers for the welfare of the nation.
Memorialist furnished him with a body-guard for his
protection. The Dalai Lama appears to be able to
keep his men well under control, and it is satisfactory
to be able to report that throughout Tibet everything
is in a peaceful condition."</p>

<p>Considering the case of these exalted personages,
we may easily indulge in the somewhat hackneyed
thankfulness that our lot has placed us in some humbler
sphere. But just as it often seems to me in England,
the poor rich get left out by all teachers, preachers,
or other apostles of glad tidings; so let us at least not
pass by on the other side, like the Pharisee of old,
but pause to breathe a prayer for the three young
men appointed, not by themselves, Emperor of Russia,
Emperor of China, and Dalai Lama of Tibet!

<p>According to Chinese usage or unwritten law,
the concubine of an Emperor can never become
Empress-Dowager; yet Tze Hsi, the concubine of
the Emperor Hien Fêng, and mother of the late
Emperor Tung Chih, has ruled over China in this
capacity since 1871. For a time she nominally shared
the power with Tze An, the childless widow of the
Emperor Hien Fêng. In like manner for a while
the youthful Kwang-shü, her step-sister's son, has been
nominal Emperor. But the ease with which she
resumed the reins in September, 1898, sufficiently shows
that she had never really let go of them. Tze,
which was also the name of the late Empress Tze
An, means "parental love," whilst An means "peace."
Hsi, the second name of the present Empress, means
"joy," and is pronounced <i>she</i>. Tze Hsi is undoubtedly
a remarkable woman. Besides having directed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
destinies of China for twenty-seven
years, without being in
the least entitled to do so, she
is said to be a brilliant artist,
often giving away her pictures;
and she also writes poetry,
having even presented six
hundred stanzas of her poetry
to the Hanlin College. Some
people suspect her of having
been instrumental in causing
the death of the Emperor
Hien Fêng, as also of his and
her son Tung Chih. She is
more than suspected of having
caused the death of her sister, the mother of the
Emperor Kwang-shü. The two ladies had a violent
altercation about the upbringing of the child, and two
days after his mother died&mdash;of pent-up anger in the
heart, it was announced. The beautiful Aleute, widow
of her son Tung Chih, certainly died by her own
hand, which is considered a very righteous act on
the part of a widow; but had her mother-in-law, the
Empress Tze Hsi, not thought that she might become
a dangerous rival, probably Aleute would not
have killed herself.</p>

<p class="caption">EMPEROR KWANG-SHÜ, 1875.<br />
<i>Lent by Society for Diffusion of
Christian and General Knowledge
in China.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is of course well known that Kwang-shü was not
the natural successor to Tung Chih. He was simply
chosen as Emperor by his ambitious aunt because he
was the very youngest person who had any claim, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
she thus secured to herself a longer lease of power.
Her sister was notoriously averse to it, and the little
Kwang-shü was stolen by the Empress Tze Hsi from
his cradle to bear the burden of an honour unto which
he was not born. The child is reported to have cried.
He was then four years old. His father was the
poetical Prince Ch`ün, who made one great tour, and
wrote a collection of poems on the novel objects he saw
during his travels. An Englishman, who knew him,
describes him as rather jovial than otherwise, but his
portrait hardly confirms this description. He was certainly
respected during his lifetime, and after his death,
as before mentioned, he was extolled in the <i>Peking
Gazette</i> for the meekness with which he had abstained
from arrogating to himself high place, in spite of being the
father of an Emperor. Probably, however, his life would
have ended sooner if he had, and he knew it. As it
was, there were suspicious circumstances about his death,
as some people thought there were about that of the
Marquis Tseng, a former Chinese Minister very popular
in England, whilst he resided here. Dr. Dudgeon,
years ago a member of the London Mission, was his
medical adviser, and he himself relates how Li Hung-chang,
celebrated for his abrupt speeches, accosted
him with, "Well, and how much did you get for poisoning
the Marquis Tseng?" "I poison the Marquis
Tseng! That was very foolish of me, considering
he was my best-paying patient." Then, after a pause,
"But if I did, how much was it your Excellency paid
me to put him out of the way?" Li Hung-chang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
lay back in his chair and chuckled, not offended but
delighted with the retort. But although the Marquis
Tseng, there is every reason to suppose, died of illness,
it seems impossible to say so of Prince Kung, who
opposed the policy of the Empress Tze Hsi, and died
almost directly afterwards, as was again said, of pent-up
anger.</p>

<p>The quarrel between the Empress and her sister
was about the method of education of the youthful
Kwang-shü. The former is openly accused of having
taught him to play cards and drink wine. And the
marvel is, not that Kwang-shü is a young man of weak
physique, and lacking in the characteristics of a Cromwell
or a Bismarck, but that he is, in spite of all, a young
man with aspirations and a real wish for his country's
good. During all my stay in China I have never heard
one single story to his disadvantage, except that at one
time people had an idea he was subject to epileptic fits,
which seems not to have been true, and that ten or
twelve years ago I have heard it said that at times
he had ungovernable fits of rage, during which he would
throw anything that came handy at the heads of those
who opposed him. This may have been true&mdash;he was
but a boy at the time&mdash;but the story has never been
confirmed, nor were those who told it the least confident
that it was true. From Chinese I have heard but one
account: "The Emperor is good. But what can he do?"
Of the Empress, on the other hand, there seems but one
opinion&mdash;that she loves money. Sometimes people add
that she has taken with ardour to gambling. But never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
have I heard any Chinaman suggest that she had the
least care of any sort for the interests of China or the
Chinese. They do not speak of her as clever. They
speak of her generally in connection with Li Hung-chang,
the unscrupulous; and they shake their heads
over them both. According to report, she has a
piercing eye. But a lady, who had been some years
in the Palace embroidering, seemed surprised at hearing
this, and implied that she had never noticed it.</p>

<p>I have heard many descriptions of the young Kwang-shü.
They all agree on one point&mdash;that he looks
sorrowful. "Very sorrowful?" I asked the other day
of an Englishman, who had seen him just before his
deposition. "Yes, very sorrowful." "Sick and sorrowful?
or more sorrowful than sick?" "More sorrowful
than sick." A private letter I once saw, written by
a man fresh from being present at an audience, gave
the impression of his being altogether overcome by
the youthful Emperor's sadness, which, as far as I
remember, was described as a cloud, that seemed to
envelop him, and remove him from the rest of the
world. This sadness seemed to be heightened by
an extreme sweetness of disposition. The youthful
Emperor smiled on seeing the beautifully illuminated
book in which the German address of congratulation was
presented, looked at it for a moment, then laid it down,
and once more was so full of sorrow it was impossible
to contemplate him without emotion. If my memory
serves me, the writer used stronger, more high-flown expressions
than I am daring to make use of. Repeating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
them at the time to the Secretary who had accompanied
the British Minister, I asked him if the Emperor
had made at all the same impression upon him. He
paused a moment, looking grave; then said firmly,
"Yes, I think quite the same."</p>

<p>Here is an extract from an account written on the
occasion of the audience of the Diplomatic Corps in
1891:</p>

<p>"All interest, however, centred in the Emperor
himself. He looks younger even than he is, not more
than sixteen or seventeen. Although his features are
essentially Chinese, or rather Manchu, they wear a
particular air of personal distinction. Rather pale and
dark, with a well-shaped forehead, long, black, arched
eyebrows, large, mournful, dark eyes, a sensitive mouth,
and an unusually long chin, the young Emperor,
together with an air of great gentleness and intelligence,
wore an expression of melancholy, due, naturally
enough, to the deprivation of nearly all the pleasures
of his age and to the strict life which the hard and
complicated duties of his high position force him to
lead. As he sat cross-legged, the table in front hid the
lower part of his person. In addressing Prince Ch´ün,
he spoke in Manchu rather low and rapidly, being
perhaps a little nervous."</p>

<p>And now it may be well to give a translation
of the best account I know, that of the <i>Ost Asiatische
Lloyd</i>, of the audience of the Foreign Ministers in
Peking at the celebration of the sixtieth birthday of
the Empress-Dowager.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span></p>

<p>"Early in the present month the Representatives
of the Treaty Powers in Peking were officially informed
by Prince Kung, the new President of the Tsung-li
Yamen, that the Emperor desired to receive the
Foreign Ministers in audience in celebration of the
sixtieth birthday of the Empress ex-Regent; and, further,
that, as a special mark of good-will, the audience would
be held within the precincts of the Inner Palace&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
in the so-called 'Forbidden City.' This audience took
place on Monday, November 12th.</p>

<p>"The theatre of this solemn function of State was
the Hall of Blooming Literature, a somewhat ancient
building in the south-east quarter of the Palace, which
is used for the annual Festival of Literature, held in the
second month, on which occasion the Emperor receives
addresses on the Classics from distinguished members
of the Hanlin College. According to a Japanese work,
entitled <i>A Description of Famous Places in the Land of
Tang</i> (<i>i.e.</i> China), which gives an illustrated description
of the ceremony, all the Presidents and Vice-Presidents
of the different Ministries in Peking, as well as high
office-bearers, have then to be present.</p>

<p>"On the present occasion the Representatives of
the Foreign Powers and their suites entered by the
Eastern Flowery Gate, which is the sole entrance in
the east wall of the Inner Palace. The sedans were
left there, and the visitors proceeded on foot through
a wide walled-in courtyard, past the Palace garden,
to the Hall of Manifested Benevolence, a smaller threefold
building in which formerly offerings were made to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
the mythical Emperors and to the ancient worthies,
and which was utilised on this occasion as waiting-room
for the Ambassadors. These were now received by
the Princes and Ministers of the Tsung-li Yamen, and
thence conducted, after a short delay, through the Wen-hua
pavilion. From there the Envoys and their suites
were conducted to the audience chamber by two Palace
officials, and then led to the throne by two Ministers
of the Tsung-li Yamen. At twenty minutes before
twelve o'clock the <i>doyen</i> of the Diplomatic Corps,
the Ambassador of the United States, was presented,
while the others followed in order of seniority. The
remainder of the ceremony was carried out as at
previous audiences. The Ambassador, followed by his
suite, approached the dais with three bows, and saluted
the Emperor seated thereon at the top of a flight of
steps: he then spoke a few words commemorating the
solemn occasion. The letter of felicitation from his
sovereign was then handed in, after each respective
Embassy interpreter had translated it into Chinese; it
was then taken by Prince Kung or Prince Ch`ing, who
stood at the Emperor's side and acted alternately with
each presentation, and translated by them into Manchu.
The Prince in question then laid the letter on a table
covered with yellow silk before the Emperor. The
monarch inclined his head as he received it, then spoke
a few sentences in an audible tone to the Prince kneeling
at his left, in which he expressed his delight and satisfaction.
The Prince, after leaving the dais, repeated
the Emperor's words in Chinese to the interpreter, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
again repeated
them in the
language of his
country to the
Ambassador.</p>

<p>"This completed
the
audience: the
Ambassador left
the hall bowing,
with the same
ceremonies, and
conducted as on
entering. Oriental
ceremonial
was thus conspicuously
and
worthily maintained.</p>

<p>"The Wen-hua-tien
has
three entrances in its southern wall, led up to by three
flights of stone steps: as long as the Ambassador was
the bearer of the Imperial handwriting, he was given
the most honoured way of approach, that is, the great
central staircase and the centre door, which otherwise
are only made use of by the Emperor in person; the
exits were made through the side door on the left.</p>

<p>"The proceedings were characterised by a distinct
majesty of demeanour. As mentioned above, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
Emperor was seated on a raised dais at a table hung
with yellow silk; behind him were the customary
paraphernalia&mdash;the screen and the peacock fan; at his
right stood two Princes of the Imperial House; at his
left the Prince of Ke Chin and Prince Kung or Prince
Ch`ing. In the hall itself two lines of guards carrying
swords were formed up, behind which stood eunuchs
and Palace officers. The most interesting feature in
the whole ceremony was of course the person of the
youthful monarch, clad in a sable robe and wearing the
hat of State. His unusually large brilliant black eyes
gave a wonderfully sympathetic aspect to his mild,
almost childish countenance, increased, if anything, by
the pallor due to a recent fever.</p>

<p>"Upon leaving the hall of audience, a strikingly
picturesque scene disclosed itself. On either side (<i>i.e.</i>
east and west, from the open staircase leading south)
were displayed the long rows of the Palace gardens in
form of a hollow bow. In front and rear swarms of
officials were moving about, clad in long robes, with
the square, many-coloured emblems of their respective
ranks embroidered on them behind and before; with all
their air of business no haste or hurry could be perceived.
Everything was being done in the solemn and majestic
manner characteristic of the Chinese official style.
Turning to the right, one noticed, at the extreme edge
of the wide court, the high wall covered with glazed
yellow tiles which encloses the long row of the central
halls of the Palace, and again to the south of these the
threefold Tso-yi-men, or 'Left Gate of Righteousness,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
and beyond that, but towering far above it, the mighty
construction of the Tai-ho Hall, which by its architectural
features is the most conspicuous building in
the whole Imperial City. As in everything Chinese,
the effect was produced not so much by the execution
of the details as by the vastness of the proportions and
the majesty of the surroundings.</p>

<p>"The Wen-hua-tien itself is an old building, sixty
or more feet in width and of almost the same depth,
which had been arranged as well as might be for the
occasion. The entrance was adorned with silken hangings
and rosettes, and pillars had been erected on the
stone staircases adorned with dragons, with yellow silk
wound round them; the centre steps and the floor were
carpeted. It cannot, however, be denied that the
Wen-hua-tien is not comparable either with the Cheng-kuang-tien
or the Tze-kuang-ko, the two halls in which
the former audiences were held, either in size or in its
internal arrangements. On the other hand, we cannot
sufficiently congratulate ourselves on the fact of the
Chinese Court having at last resolved to open the door
of the 'Inner Palace' to the Foreign Representatives.
These doors have been so long and anxiously guarded,
that it was a hard matter for the Court to give way in
the weary discussions over the audience question&mdash;how
hard may be inferred from the number of years it has
taken to bring about this final solution."</p>

<p>An account of another audience, given at the time
in the <i>Chinese Times</i>, since defunct, but then published
at Tientsin, the nearest Treaty Port to Peking, gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
a few details that are perhaps the more interesting
from their contrast with the very careful account
above quoted, obviously written by a gentleman connected
with Diplomacy:</p>

<p>"When the procession reached the North Gate,
leading into the garden near the Marble Bridge, the
Ministers and others left their chairs and proceeded
on foot to a kind of small pavilion, where a collation
was served, and where the party waited an hour
surrounded by mandarins and a crowd of roughs&mdash;chair-coolies
(not those of the Legations, who had been
left outside), workmen, gardeners, porters, and coolies&mdash;who
peered in at the windows, and even allowed themselves
to make digital examination of the uniforms and
decorations of the Ministers. After a lapse of an hour
the party were conducted into three tents erected at
the foot of the steps of the Tze-kuang-ko, where,
divided into three groups&mdash;Ministers, attachés, and
interpreters&mdash;they remained half an hour. Then the
Emperor arrived, and M. Von Brandt was the first
to enter the presence, where he remained exactly five
minutes, all ceremonies included. He was followed by
the other Ministers in turn, the audience occupying
barely five minutes for each. Then the suites of the
Ministers entered, in three ranks. Three salvoes were
given on entrance and three on retiring, backwards.</p>

<p>"The audience itself was conducted as follows:
M. Von Brandt, the German Minister, delivered a
very short speech in English, which M. Popoff, Russian,
translated into Chinese; Prince Ch`ing repeated it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
kneeling, in Manchu, at the foot of the throne. The
Emperor said a few prepared words in reply, which
were translated in the reverse order, and the Ministers
retired. The Emperor was at a distance of seven or
eight yards from the Europeans, raised on a dais
with a table in front of him. Behind him stood the
Pao-wang and the Ko-wang; at the foot of the dais
Prince Ch`ing; and on either side soldiers with side
arms. The hall was not a large one; the Europeans
were placed near the centre, between two pillars. The
rabble crowded up the steps of the Tze-kuang-ko, and
no order was kept."</p>

<p>This crowding of the rabble is eminently Chinese,
as also that no steps were taken to save the Representatives
of the various countries of Europe from
the impertinent and dirty hands of workmen and
coolies. It is extraordinary to think of European
diplomatists submitting to it. Of course they would
not have done so, but for the mutual jealousies among
themselves. It is this that always gives China her
advantage. It is also remarkable that Herr von
Brandt should have spoken in English, a fact ignored
in German newspapers, although it must have been
prearranged, and doubtless after much consideration.
But the fact that all this assemblage of Ministers
Plenipotentiary with attendant secretaries allowed a
Chinese rabble thus to insult them in their official
capacity will perhaps make intelligible in England, why
our hearts often grow hot within us, while sojourning
in China, and our cheeks sometimes burn with shame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
for our country, which we know to be so strong, and
which allows itself at times to be so humiliated by a
nation, that naturally becomes more arrogant, seeing
itself allowed thus to act. I do not know who the
writer of the following poem is; but he expresses
my feelings with more calm and dignity than I could
myself; therefore I hope he will not be displeased by
my quoting it.</p>

<p>Possibly that state of society in which the individual
is the unit is a more advanced form of
civilisation; but it is impossible to understand China
unless it be first realised that the individual life is
nothing there, and that the family is the unit; and
yet further, that no one stands alone in China, as is so
painfully the case in England, but that every one is
responsible for some one else, guaranteed by some one
else. And here, to those who wish to read a really
exact, circumstantial account of the Chinese and their
ways, let me recommend <i>John Chinaman</i>, by the Rev.
George Cockburn, quite the best book I have read
on the subject, and one that deserves a wider circulation
than it has attained, being written in terse,
epigrammatic English, with a flavour of Tacitus about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
it. Alas! the writer is no more,&mdash;a silent, reserved,
black-browed Scotchman, with a fervour of missionary
zeal glowing under a most impassive exterior. The
riot, in which all our own worldly goods in China were
destroyed, wrecked for ever the nervous system of
his strong, handsome, brave young wife. And what
with that and the details of daily life, all laid upon
the shoulders of a man by nature a student and a
visionary, he left China, and soon after passed away
beyond the veil, where, if we share the Chinese belief,
let us trust his spirit is gladdened by words of appreciation
of the one little volume in which he embodied
the fruits of years of work and thought in China,
dying, as far as I remember, almost as it appeared.
The wreckage of missionary lives and hopes is one of
the tragedies of European life in China, and one which
a little more understanding and sympathy on the part
of missionary boards at home might often, it would
seem, avert.</p>

<p>But to return to the Chinese. If you engage a
servant, he is <i>secured</i> by some one to a certain amount,
and all you have to do is to ascertain whether the
security is in a position to pay should the other decamp
with your property, also whether a higher value is likely
to be at his disposition. If yours is a well-arranged
household, this head man engages the other servants
and secures them, reprimanding and discharging them
at his pleasure. He, of course, gets a certain amount
of the wages you think you are paying them. This,
in China, the land of it, is called a "squeeze." But it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
seems perfectly legitimate, as indeed all squeezes
seem legitimate from the Chinese point of view, only
sometimes carried to excess. It is the same in business.
It is not quite the same in official positions, because
there the Viceroy of a province pays so much to get
his post, and so do the lesser officials under him. The
theory in China is that superior men will always act as
such, whatever their pay may be. Therefore a Chinese
Viceroy of to-day receives theoretically the living wage
of centuries ago. Practically he receives squeezes from
every one with whom he is brought in contact, and
has paid so much down to acquire the post that unless
he holds it for a term of years he is out of pocket.
The post of Taotai, or Governor of Shanghai, is one
of the most lucrative in China. Tsai, who has made
friends with all of us Europeans as no Taotai ever
did before&mdash;dining out and giving dinner parties, and
even balls&mdash;Tsai is known to have paid so much to
obtain the post as would represent all he could hope
to get in every way during two years of office: about
£20,000. He was dismissed from his post November,
1898; but possibly may be able to bribe heavily enough
to get it back. Li Hung-chang and his two particular
dependants of former days, the late Viceroy of
Szechuan, degraded because of the anti-foreign riots
there, and Shêng, Chief of Telegraphs and Railways,
etc., etc., have all done this again and again. When
English people were laughing over Li's yellow jacket
and peacock feather being taken from him, certain
eunuchs of the Palace were growing rich over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
process of getting them back again. The eunuch in
the closest confidence of the Empress is always said
to charge about £1,000 for an interview, and till lately
none could be obtained but through him. When a
man has enormous wealth, and is degraded, every
one naturally feels it is a pity nothing should be got
out of him, and he equally naturally is willing to pay
much in order to be reinstated in a position to make
more. Until the officials of China are properly paid,
it is unreasonable to expect them to be honest. And
yet some are so even now: not only Chang-chih-tung,
the incorruptible Viceroy of Hupeh and Hunan, who,
it may be noticed, is constantly being invited to Peking,
but&mdash;<i>never</i> goes. But others in subordinate positions
are pointed out by Chinese: "That is one of the good
old school of Chinamen. He takes no bribes, and is
the terror of the other officials."</p>

<p>In family life Chinese solidarity has its inconveniences,
but it altogether prevents that painful
spectacle to which people seem to have hardened their
hearts in England, of sending their aged relatives to
the workhouse instead of carefully tending them at
home as the Chinese do, or of one brother or sister
surrounded by every luxury, another haunted by the
horror of creditors and with barely the necessaries of
life. If you are to help your brother, you must, of
course, claim a certain amount of authority over his
way of life. In China the father does so; and when
he dies, the elder brother sees after <i>and</i> orders his
younger brother about; and the younger brother, as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
rule, submits. In each of those large and beautiful
homesteads in which Chinese live in the country, adding
only an additional graceful roof-curve, another courtyard,
as more sons bring home more young women to
be wives in name, but in reality to be the servants-of-all-work
of their mothers, and the mothers of their
children&mdash;in each of these harmonious agglomerations
of courtyards, it is the eldest man who directs the
family councils. Thus, when a man dies, the deciding
voice is for his eldest brother, not for his eldest son;
than which probably no custom could tend more to
conservatism, for there never comes a time when the
voice of youth makes itself heard with authority.</p>

<p>Not only are all the members of a family thus knit
together by mutual responsibilities, but families are
again thus knit. It is the village elders who are
responsible if any crime is committed in the district.
It is they who have to discover and bring back stolen
articles; it is they who have to quiet disturbances and
settle disputes about boundaries. The principle of
local self-government has in the course of centuries
been perfected in China, where all that Mr. Ruskin
aims at appears to have been attained centuries ago:
village industries, local self-government, no railways,
no machinery, hand labour, and each village, as far
as possible each self-sufficing family, growing its own
silk or cotton, weaving at home its own cloth, eating
its own rice and beans, and Indian corn and pork.
Schools are established by little collections of families,
or tutors engaged, as the case may be. In either case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
the teacher is poorly paid, but meets with a respect
altogether out of proportion to his salary. It is all
very ideal; but the result is not perfect, human nature
being what it is. In many ways, however, it appears
a much happier system than our English system, and
perhaps in consequence the people of China appear
very contented. As a rule in the country each family
tills its own bit of ground, and&mdash;where opium has not
spread its poisonous influence&mdash;has held the same for
centuries. The family tree is well known, and Chinese
will tell you quietly "We are Cantonese," or "We are
from Hunan," and only careful inquiry will elicit that
their branch of the family came thence some three
centuries ago.</p>

<p>In the towns the guilds represent family life on a
larger scale. A man comes from Kiangsi, let us say,
to Chungking, over a thousand miles away, and having
probably spent months on the journey. He has brought
no letters of introduction, but he straightway goes to
the guild-house of his province, with its particularly
beautiful green-tiled pagoda overlooking the river, a
pale-pink lantern hanging from the upturned end of
each delightful roof-curve, and there, making due
reverence, he relates how he is So-and-so, the son of
So-and-so, and straightway every one there knows all
about him, and can easily ascertain if his story be
correct. Here are friends found for him at once, a
free employment agency, if that is what he is after,
or a bureau of information about the various businesses
of the city, their solvency and the like. Here is a lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
club-house, where he can dine or be dined, have private
and confidential conversations in retired nooks, or sit
with all the men of his province sipping tea and eating
cakes, while a play is performed before them by their
own special troupe of actors, who act after the manner
of their province. I do not know who first started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>
the legend that Chinese plays last for days, if not weeks.
But it is not true, any more than that green tea is
rendered green by being fired in copper pans and is
poison to the nerves. Tea is green by nature, though
it may be rendered black by fermentation, and is always
fired in iron pans; and weak green tea as drunk in
China is like balm to the nerves compared to Indian
tannin-strong decoctions. In like manner Chinese
plays are really short, though they make up in noise
for what they lack in length.</p>

<p class="caption">KIANGSI GUILD-HOUSE IN CHUNGKING.<br />
<i>By Mrs. Archibald Little.</i></p>
</div>

<p>If occasion needed, the guild would see after the
newcomers funeral, even give him free burial if the
worst came to the worst. And though we reckon
the Chinese people such an irreligious race, and the
guild-houses are naturally only frequented by men,
chiefly by merchants (for the Chinese are a nation
of traders), yet in every guild-house there is a temple.
And before every great banquet part of the ceremony
of marshalling the guests to their seats (and a very
stately ceremony it is) is pouring a libation of wine
before an altar in the banqueting-hall, before which
also each guest bows in turn as he passes to the place
assigned him.</p>

<p>But probably the custom that has the greatest
effect upon Chinese life is that, just as twelve centuries
ago they introduced competitive examinations, to which
we have now in our nineteenth century of Christianity
turned as to a sheet-anchor, so centuries ago the
Chinese resorted to the principle of co-operation. In
a Chinese business, be it large or be it small, pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
well every man in the business has his share; so that
you are sometimes astonished when a merchant introduces
to you as his partners a set of young men,
who in England would be junior clerks. Even the
coolie wrappering the tea-boxes says "<i>We</i> are doing
well this year," and works with a will through the
night, knowing he too will have his portion in the
increased business this increased work signifies. The
way, indeed, in which Chinese work through the night
is most remarkable. Men will row a boat day and
night for four or five days, knowing that the sum of
money gained will thus be quicker earned, and only
pausing one at a time to take a whiff at a pipe or to
eat. They will press wool all through the night to
oblige their employer without a murmur, if only given
free meals whilst doing this additional work. The
truth is, the habit of industry has been so engendered
in Chinese as to be second nature, their whole system
tending to encourage it, whilst ours, with our free
poor-houses and licensed public-houses, tends rather in
the other direction; our Trades Unions seem trying
all they can to further diminish the incentives to good
work on the part of skilled workmen by denying them
any higher wage than that obtained by the incompetent.
Co-operation after the Chinese model will, it is to be
hoped, eventually put this right again. There is so
much we might learn from the Chinese; but we have
never followed the system we press upon Oriental
nations, of sending out clever young students to other
countries to see what they can learn that would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
advantageous among our own people. In some ways
China would serve as a warning. But a civilisation,
that reached its acme while William the Norman was
conquering England, and that yet survives intact, must
surely have many a lesson to teach.</p>

<p>Besides all this mutual support and responsibility,
Chinese customs are such that, as people often say
somewhat sadly, you cannot alter one without altering
all. The people here referred to are not the twenty-years-in-China-and-not-speak-a-word-of-the-language
men, but Europeans who have tried to study the
Chinese sympathetically. As it is, if you were to alter
their houses and make them less draughty and damp,
then all their clothing must be altered. That is again
the case if you try to encourage them to play cricket&mdash;for
which there is no sufficient level space in the west
of China&mdash;or take part in other sports. But if you
were to attempt to alter their clothing before you had
rebuilt their houses, they would all be dying of dysentery
or fever. In like manner, if you attempted to dragoon
the Chinese into greater cleanliness, or into taking
certain sanitary precautions, you would require a police
force, which does not exist. But how to obtain that
until you have got this self-respecting, self-governing
people to see any advantage in being dragooned?</p>

<p>The solidarity of the Chinese race is one of the
reasons it has lasted so long upon the earth, and its
civilisation remained the same. It is twenty-one
centuries since the Emperor Tze Hoang-ti said "Good
government is impossible under a multiplicity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
masters," and did away with the feudal system. It
is twelve centuries since the Chinese found out what
Burns only taught us the other day, that "A man's a
man for a' that," and, giving up the idea of rank, began
to fill posts by competitive examinations. Another of
their most remarkable methods we shall probably copy
whenever we begin seriously to consider Imperial
Federation. They never send any man to be an
official in his own province. Thus we should have
Canadian officials in places of trust here or in Australia,
and Australians in England or Canada. <i>And to each
province in China so many Government posts, civil and
military, are assigned.</i> If England had followed this
method, there might be the United States of England
now instead of America, for no system is better calculated
to knit closely together the outlying regions of
a great empire, than that in accordance with which
every official in turn has to be examined as to his
qualifications for office at the capital, and to return
there to pay his respects to his sovereign before
entering upon each new office.</p>

<p>The contemplation of China is discouraging: to
think it got so far so long ago, and yet has got no
farther! The Emperor Hoang-ti, who lived 200 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>,
may be supposed to have foreseen the deadening effect
that government by literary men has upon a nation,
for he burnt all their books except those that treat of
practical arts. He was even as advanced as Mr
Auberon Herbert, and warned rulers against the
multiplication of unnecessary laws. Laotze, China's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
greatest sage, although too spiritually-minded a man to
have gained such a following as was afterwards obtained
by Confucius, again insists that the spiritual weapons
of this world cannot be formed by laws and regulations:
"Prohibitory enactments, and too constant intermeddling
in political and social matters, merely produce
the evils they are intended to avert. The ruler is
above all things to practise <i>wu-wei</i>, or inaction."</p>

<p>The Chinese, it seems, experimented in socialism
eight centuries ago. The Emperor Chin-tsung II., at
a very early age, and led thereto by Wu-gan-chi, the
compiler of a vast encyclopædia, conceived the idea
that "the State should take the entire management of
commerce, industry, and agriculture into its own hands,
with the view of succouring the working classes and
preventing their being ground to the dust by the rich."
To quote again from W. D. Babington's <i>Fallacies of
Race Theories</i>: "The poor were to be exempt from
taxation, land was to be assigned to them, and seed-corn
provided. Every one was to have a sufficiency;
there were to be no poor and no over-rich. The
literati in vain resisted the innovations, the fallacy of
which they demonstrated from their standpoint. The
specious arguments of the would-be reformer convinced
the young Emperor and gained the favour of the people.
Wu-gan-chi triumphed. The vast province of Shensi
was chosen as the theatre for the display of the great
social experiment that was to regenerate mankind. The
result was failure, complete and disastrous. The people,
neither driven by want nor incited by the hope of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
gain, ceased to labour; and the province was soon in
a fair way to become a desert." Mencius, Confucius'
greatest follower, taught that "the people are the
most important element in the country, and the ruler
is the least." Mencius openly said that if a ruler did
not rule for his people's good it was a duty to resist
his authority and depose him.</p>

<p>Whilst other nations have vaguely asked <i>Quis custodiet
custodes?</i> the Chinese invented the College of
Censors and the Tribunal of History, both selected
from their most distinguished scholars. It is the duty
of Censors to remonstrate with the Emperor when
necessary, as well as to report to the College, or to the
Emperor himself, any breach of propriety in courts of
justice or elsewhere. They have no especial office but
to notice the doings of other officials. The Tribunal of
History is busy recording the events of each Emperor's
reign; but no Emperor has ever seen what is written
about him, nor is any history published till the
dynasty of which it treats is at an end. Chinese history
is full of examples of the courage and adherence to
truth with which the members of this tribunal have
been inspired.</p>

<p>It is all so beautiful in description, one sighs in
thinking it over. But it must be remembered that it
was yet more beautiful, startlingly beautiful, at the
period of the world's history when it was all originated,
and that to this day the Chinese peasant enjoys a degree
of liberty and immunity from Government interference
unknown on the Continent of Europe. There is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
passport system; he can travel where he pleases; he
can form and join any kind of association; his Press
was free till the Empress Tze Hsi, probably inspired by
Russian influence, issued her edict against it in 1898;
his right of public meeting and free speech are still
unquestioned. Public readers and trained orators travel
about the country instructing the people. The system
of appealing to the people by placarding the walls has
been very far developed in China. There is there
complete liberty of conscience. And at the same time,
as all people who know China will testify, the moral
conscience of the people is so educated that an appeal to
it never falls flat, as it often would in England. Try
to stop two men fighting, saying it is wrong to fight,
and you will hear no one say in China, "Oh, let them
fight it out!" Appeal to the teaching of Confucius,
and every Chinaman will treat you with respect, and
at least try to appear guided by it. How far in
Europe would this be the case with a citation from the
Bible?</p>

<p>The system of education, the crippling of the women
by footbinding, and consequent enfeebling of the race,
together with the subsequent resort to opium-smoking,
are the three apparent evil influences that spoil what
otherwise seems so ideal a system of civilisation. Possibly
we should add to this, that the system of Confucius&mdash;China's
great teacher&mdash;is merely a system of ethics, and
that thus for generations the cultured portion of the
nation has tried to do without a religion, although falling
back upon Taoism and Buddhism to meet the needs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
the human heart. That any civilisation should have lasted
so long without a living religion is surprising. But
Buddhism has evidently had an enormous influence upon
China, though its temples are crumbling now, its priests
rarely knowing even its first elements. The good that
it could do for China it has done. And now another
influence is needed.</p>

<p>On February 12th, 1896, a newspaper correspondent
wrote from Peking: "The Reform Club established
a few months ago, which gave such promise
of good things to come, and which has been referred
to frequently in the public prints in China, has burst.
It has been denounced by one of the Censors, and the
Society has collapsed at once. The Club has been
searched, the members, some fifty or more Hanlin
scholars, have absconded, and the printers have been
imprisoned. Such is the end, for the present at least,
of what promised to be the awakening of China. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
was initiated and supported largely at least by three
well-known foreigners, two of them well-known missionaries,
and it met with much support and encouragement
from all classes. Its little <i>Gazette</i> was latterly
enlarged and its name changed. One or more translators
were engaged to translate the best articles
from the English newspapers and magazines, of which
some two dozen or more were ordered for the Club.
The members contributed liberally, we understand,
towards its expenses; and if ever there was hope of
new life being instilled into the old dry bones of China,
it was certainly confidently looked for from this young,
healthy, and vigorous Society. It has been conducted,
we believe, with great ability; differences among the
leaders have cropped up, but after discussions the affairs
of the Club have each time been placed on a more
secure and lasting basis. Foreign dinners at a native
hotel have been part of the programme; and this element
is not to be despised by any means. The Chinese
transact nearly all their important business at the tea-shops
and restaurants, and certainly a good dinner and
a glass of champagne help wonderfully to smooth
matters. We regret exceedingly the decease of the
Reform Club."</p>

<p>People in general laughed about it a little. There
had before been the short statement: "A Censor has
impeached the new Hanlin Reform Club, and it has been
closed by Imperial rescript."</p>

<p>Thomas Huxley once wrote that "with wisdom
and uprightness even a small nation might make its way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
worthily; no sight in the world is more saddening and
revolting than is offered by men sunk in ignorance of
everything except what other men have written, and
seemingly devoid of moral belief and guidance, yet
with their sense of literary beauty so keen and their
power of expression so cultivated that they mistake
their own caterwauling for the music of the spheres."</p>

<p>It was in this strain Europeans in the East
meditated. But on returning to China in the autumn
of 1897, I found in Shanghai evidences of progress
and reform on all sides. A Chinese newspaper,
generally spoken of in English as <i>Chinese Progress</i>, was
being issued regularly, and newspapers edited by friends
of its editor were coming out in Hunan and even in
far-away Szechuan. The Chinese "Do-not-bind-feet"
Society of Canton had opened an office in one of the
principal streets of Shanghai, and was memorialising
Viceroys, as also the Superintendents of Northern and
Southern trade. Directly on arrival I received an invitation
to a public dinner in the name of ten Chinese
ladies, of whom I had never heard before. It was to
be in the large dining-hall in a Chinese garden in the
Bubbling Well Road, the fashionable drive of Shanghai,
and by degrees I found all my most intimate friends
were invited. We agreed with one another to go,
though wondering a good deal what the real meaning
of the invitation was, and why we were selected. The
hall is a very large one, sometimes used for big balls,
with rooms opening off it on either side; and after the
English ladies had laid aside their wraps in a room to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
the right&mdash;one or two Chinese gentlemen, who had
evidently been superintending the arrangement of the
dinner, encouraging them to do so&mdash;we asked where
our Chinese hostesses were. They were already assembled
in the rooms opening off the hall to the left, and
I still remember the expression of intense anxiety on
the Chinese gentlemen's faces as they saw us leave
them and advance to join their womenkind, none
of whom spoke any English, nor knew anything of
English ways and manners. At first the Chinese
ladies did not exactly receive us; but when we began
to go round and bow to each lady in turn, after the
Chinese fashion, one after another stood up and smilingly
greeted us. Then those of us who could talked
Chinese, and one or two of the Chinese ladies began to
move about, exhibiting the ground-plan of a proposed
school for the higher education of Chinese young ladies.
And thus gradually we began to understand what it
was all about. But on that occasion it was the English
ladies who were frivolous, the Chinese who were serious.
For they were so elaborately dressed, so covered with
ornaments, English ladies were always breaking off
and saying, "Oh, do allow me to admire that bracelet!"
or "What lovely embroidery!" whilst the Chinese
ladies very earnestly pointed at their ground-plan, and
looked interrogations. It gradually came out that it was
the Manager of the Telegraph Company and his friends
who were bent upon starting this school; that this being
a new departure they thought it well for the ladies
interested to confer with the ladies of other nations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
accustomed to education; and that, considering who
was likely to be helpful, they had asked a few missionary
ladies, and all the officers and committee of the T`ien
Tsu Hui ("Natural Feet Society"), thinking that the
foreign ladies, who had started that, must be interested
in helping Chinese women.</p>

<p>Presently we were summoned to dinner by an
intimation, "Chinese ladies to the left, foreign ladies to
the right!" "Because of the fire," was added <i>sotto voce</i>,
for Chinese, in their often triple furs, have naturally a
horror of fires; but we refused to be thus summarily
separated, as we sat down about two hundred women to
a dinner served in the foreign style, with champagne,
etc., and were rather alarmed to find our hostesses
allowing their little children to drink as freely of
champagne as of their own light Chinese wines.</p>

<p class="caption">MR. KING, MANAGER OF THE CHINESE
TELEGRAPH COMPANY AND FOUNDER
OF HIGH SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS.</p>
</div>

<p>That dinner was the beginning of an interchange of
civilities between foreign and Chinese ladies such as
had never occurred before. The daughter of Kang,
commonly called the Modern Sage, after the title given
to Confucius, was naturally one of these ladies. She
wore Manchu dress, which puzzled us, as she is
Cantonese. Her father had never allowed her feet to
be bound, and she had herself written an article against
binding, which had appeared in a Chinese newspaper;
thus she, like several other Chinese ladies, considered
the dress of the Manchus, who never bind feet, the
most convenient. The relations of Mr. Liang, editor of
<i>Chinese Progress</i>, were also present. At the subsequent
meetings some of the Chinese ladies pleaded earnestly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
that Europeans should take shares in the school. They
did not want their money, they said, but feared that
unless there were European shareholders their Government
might seize all the funds. The European ladies,
however, could never
quite satisfy themselves
as to the various
guarantees necessary.
There were, indeed,
many difficulties about
starting this new school,
as may be seen by the
following letter, written
by two Chinese lady
doctors, who had been
asked in the first instance
to undertake its
management. They
had been educated in
America, where they
had passed all the
necessary examinations
very brilliantly; and it
was the idea of the lustre they had thus conferred
upon their own nation in a foreign land, that had first
led a wealthy ship-owner, running steamers on the
Poyang Lake, to conceive the idea of a school for
girls. It had been warmly taken up by the late tutor
of the ladies of the Imperial Household, who had been
dismissed from his post because of his radical notions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
and was thus free to devote himself to advancing
education generally. The Manager of the Telegraph
Company then became the leader, and the prospectus of
the school was published in the <i>North China Herald</i>,
with the names of the two Chinese lady doctors as its
managers. On which they wrote the following letter to
the editor, which, as I afterwards ascertained, was <i>bonâ
fide</i> written by themselves, not at foreign instigation.
They even refused to accept any corrections, saying if
they wrote it at all it must be their own letter. It is
so striking as the composition of Chinese women, that I
am sure I shall be pardoned for giving it <i>in extenso</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your issue of December 24th appeared
a translation of the prospectus of a school in Shanghai
for Chinese girls; and since our names were given to
the public as would-be teachers, we hope you will permit
a word of much-needed explanation. If you, Mr. Editor,
give such welcome to this sign of progress as is expressed
in your editorial, then much more should those of our
own people, who may be prepared to appreciate its
possibilities. Yet the joy might not be without alloy.</p>

<p>"Several months ago the prospectus was brought
to us as yet in an unfinished state, and parts of the
first and last clauses referring to the establishment of
Confucianism did not appear. Had these been there,
we should not have allowed our names to go down
as teachers. In making this statement, we realise that
we only escape the charge of 'narrow-mindness' by the
fact that we decidedly are not foreigners. We love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
our native China too much to fail to realise the truth
in your admission 'that a slavish adherence to Confucianism
alone has done far too much to limit and
confine the Chinese mind for centuries,' and it is
because we are not hopeful of the result 'when reverence
for Confucianism is to be combined with the
study of Western languages and sciences' that we
cannot lend ourselves to the project as it seems to be
drifting. It was with the express understanding that
there should be entire religious liberty, that we consented
to take up this work, and religious liberty would
admit all who found moral and spiritual support in
Confucianism to avail themselves of it. The tablets,
that Confucianism cherished, might be set up by its
supporters near the school, but not in the grounds: as
might Christian churches be opened, if friends were
found to build them. Such a course would conserve
liberty of conscience.</p>

<p>"Now, according to the prospectus published in
that very excellent Chinese journal <i>The Progress</i>, twice
a year sacrifices are to be made in this school to
posthumous tablets of Confucius and such worthy patrons
of the school as may be honoured by a place in its
pantheon. Had the statement been made that twice
a year days would be set apart as memorial days to
these distinguished personages, upon which occasions
their lives should be reviewed to us in a manner to
inspire young girls by their examples, no one would
join more heartily in paying honour to their memory
than ourselves. But the idea of sacrifice to human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
beings seems too blind in the light of this nineteenth
century for any participation on our part. We have
seen other countries, and learned of the sages of other
lands; and although it may be only because of prejudice,
yet we can truly say that we honour none as
we do our own Confucius. But honour to the best
of human beings is not unmixed blessing when it
creates an idol and holds the eyes of the devotees
down to earth. We do not think it the sentiment
that will make the education of women successful or
even safe. The educational institutions for women
during the time of the Three Dynasties were not of
the excellent things that Confucius sought to reestablish.
Had he done so, how could he have uttered
such words as these?&mdash;'Of all people girls and servants
are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar
to them, they lose their humility. If you maintain
your reserve, they are discontented' (see <i>Legge's
Classics</i>). Alas that we have no record that the
Master ever turned his attention to a remedy for such
a sad state of affairs!</p>

<p>"One there was who never spoke in disparaging
tone to or of women. Only His sustaining counsel
could give us courage to start out upon the pathway,
slippery as it must needs be in the present
stage of China's civilisation, along which educated
women must needs pick their way. We do not feel
that we should be doing our country-women best
service in starting them out with only a Confucian
outfit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span></p>

<p>"This prospectus is, no doubt, intended to be a
working-plan that will carry the co-operation of the
largest number. We realise it is easier to see its
inconsistencies than to unite opposing factions. Doubtless
it embraces a truly progressive element in the
land which has compromised under the proposed cult.
The articles at first brought to us contained two
sections aimed against concubinage and girl-slavery.
When we reflect upon these destroyers that have fixed
upon the vitals of Chinese home life, and then read
the substitution of the words referring to Shanghai
girls, 'especially in the Settlements,' Mencius' words
recur to us (see <i>Legge's Classics</i>): 'Here is a man
whose fourth finger is bent and cannot be stretched
out straight.... If there be any one who can make
it straight, he will not think the way from Tsin to
Ts`oo far to go.... When a man's finger is not like
that of other people, he knows he feels dissatisfied;
but if his mind differs, he feels no dissatisfaction.
This is called "Ignorance of the relative importance
of things!"' We fear the day of our Chinese deliverance
is not quite at hand.</p>

<p>"The Spirit that can mould the hearts of men has
been abroad and wrought in the hearts of many, or
they would not so ardently desire something progressive;
but we regret to see it quenched even in a reviving
flood of Confucianism. Let us intreat you, friends of
China's progress, to lend your influence to the leaders
of our people, that they strive not to bottle the
new wine (spirit) of progress in old bottles, 'else the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the
bottles perish.'</p>

<p class="p2">Somehow, however, all difficulties were surmounted,
and in June, 1898, I had the pleasure of writing the
following account of the first high school for girls
opened in China:</p>

<p>"Turning off to the left from the long green avenue
but a few minutes before arriving at the Arsenal, the
visitor comes upon the pretty conglomeration of buildings
in which the much-talked-of Chinese young ladies'
school has now actually been opened. There are the
usual Chinese courtyards, with somewhat more than
the usual fantastic Chinese decoration, ornamental tiles
making open screens rather than walls, through which
the wind can blow freely, yet at the same time giving
a feeling of privacy; as also writhing dragons and
birds and beasts. It is quite Chinese, and very pretty
and æsthetic. But the windows are foreign, and there
is no house in the European settlement more airy, nor
perhaps so clean.</p>

<p>"But the matter of interest is not the building,
nor the furniture, but the teachers and the taught.
There they stood, the sixteen young girls, who are
the first promise of the regeneration of China; and
judged as young girls they certainly promised remarkably
well. It is natural to suppose that several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
of them are the children of parents of more than
ordinary enlightenment. But whether they are or
not, they certainly looked it. Their manners were
naturally very superior to those of the girls one is
accustomed to see in Chinese schools. They were
readier to laugh and see a joke. But if some of those
girls do not decidedly distinguish themselves in the
years to come, it will be the fault of their instructors,
or I am no physiognomist. They were busy with
reading-books, and the teacher, a nice quiet-looking
Chinese woman, had not the least idea of showing
them off, so it was hard to test them. She said she
could not say yet herself which were the brightest
girls. Several had natural feet, and most of the others
were eager to state they had "let out" their feet.
None were the least smartly dressed, but several had
very well-dressed hair, and were very neatly shod.
One girl had the Manchu shoe without that objectionable
heel in the middle, that must make walking on
it like walking upon stilts.</p>

<p>"The bedrooms were all upstairs, four girls in a
room, and nothing could have looked cleaner and neater
than the arrangements: white mosquito curtains round
the bed, a box under each for the girl's clothes, a stool
for her to sit upon; one shining wardrobe amongst
the four; a washstand with rail at the back on which
to hang towels, and a looking-glass in the centre. The
teachers had rooms to themselves. The teacher of
sewing was upstairs, with only too exquisitely fine work
all ready to spoil the poor girls' eyes and exercise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
their patience. There was another lady, who has
been teaching drawing in the Imperial Palace, painting
for the Empress there. Whether she is only on a
visit to recover her health, or is now teaching drawing
in this school&mdash;they have a drawing mistress&mdash;I did
not quite make out. But she is the sort of woman
whom one seems to know, by her clever, thoughtful,
extremely observant face, before ever speaking to her;
and when I found she was from Yunnan, we sat and
chatted about 'Mount Omi and Beyond' in quite a
friendly way. One of Miss Heygood's Chinese pupils
is to come in on Monday and begin teaching English,
as they think a Chinese teacher will do for a beginning.
Probably she will understand Chinese difficulties better
than any of us could. But it is a question whether her
pronunciation can be quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>"A good deal of the furniture was foreign, and
it seemed to be all foreign in the long reception-room,
to be eventually used as a class-room, where on
Wednesday, June 1st, a large company of foreign
ladies sat down to a most excellent Chinese dinner,
with knives and forks for those who wanted, and
champagne served freely. The two previous days
gentlemen had been received, and June 2nd was to
be exclusively for Chinese ladies. One of the daughters
of Mr. King, Manager of the Telegraphs, presided at
one end of the table at which I was, and his daughter-in-law
sat at the other end. There was another table
in an adjoining room. Mrs. Shen Tun-ho and Mrs.
King Lien-shan had cards printed in English with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
'Chinese Girl School Committee' in the corner. Mrs.
Mei Shen-in had on hers, 'Native Director of Chinese
Female School.'</p>

<p>"It is difficult for ladies to decide what guarantee
is obtainable that any money they may contribute will
be well used, and not diverted from the purpose for
which it is intended. But if some of the active business
men of Shanghai can make the necessary inquiries on
these heads, certainly what was to be seen on June 1st
sufficiently spoke for the great energy and care displayed
by the Ladies' Committee, and Mr. King, who
is understood to be the prime mover in the matter.
Every detail seemed to have been well seen after.
Even baths and a bath-room are provided. Each girl
is only to pay six shillings a month; and this being
so, it is not to be wondered at that already another
house is being secured, and there are promises of
sufficient girl pupils already to fill it. There is also
talk of opening another girls' school."</p>

<p>And now in 1899 I hear that already a third school
for girls has been started by Mr. King, whose energy
in the matter is the more to be admired when it is
considered that he is so deaf all communication with
him has to be carried on in writing. But, alas for
China! Mr. Timothy Richard, the inspiring secretary
of the Society for the Diffusion of Christian and General
Knowledge, has had to take over the schools and put
in a European manager, to save them from the Empress
Tze Hsi's grasping fingers.</p>

<p class="caption">WÊN TING-SHIH, THE REFORMER, LATE TUTOR TO THE
LADIES OF THE IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD.<br />
<i>Lent by Rev. Gilbert Reid.</i></p>
</div>

<p>But a few days after the ladies' dinner&mdash;a very merry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
one&mdash;we were invited by three Chinese gentlemen to
meet the Mr. Wên before mentioned as late tutor to
the ladies of the Imperial Household. There were only
four other Europeans, and a little party of Chinese men,
all members of the Reform party. It is perhaps as well
not to give their names, two of that little company
being at this moment under sentence of death themselves,
together with all their relations. When last
heard of they were hiding, but some of their relations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
had been seized. The dinner was a very sad one.
They had evidently invited Europeans as a drowning
man catches at a straw, to see if they could devise
anything to save the Chinese people. But to each
suggestion made they said it was impossible. There
was nothing&mdash;nothing to be done at Peking. Corruption
prevailed over everything there. There was
nothing&mdash;nothing to be done with the various Viceroys.
There was nothing to be done by an appeal to the
people. The only thing was to go on writing and
writing, translating from foreign languages, and thus
gradually educating the people in what might be useful
to them. The memory of that dinner cannot easily
pass from those present. Some of us walked away
together too sad for words, and all that evening a great
cloud of depression rested over us. For we felt we
had witnessed despair; and when a Chinaman, usually
so impassive, gives way, it makes the more impression.</p>

<p>But then happened the astonishing, as always occurs
in China; and when next heard of, the Emperor of
China himself, the youthful Kwang-shü, was at the
head of the Progress party. All that has been told
of Kwang-shü has always been very interesting and
pleasing. Chinese people all speak well of him, and
say he wishes for his country's good. But then they
shrug their shoulders, for they have always maintained
he has no power. At one time he was said to be
studying English, at another reading Shakespeare in
translation. On the occasion of the Empress Tze
Hsi's sixtieth birthday all Christian women in China
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
were invited to subscribe for a handsome copy of the
New Testament, which was eventually presented to
her in a silver casket beautifully chased with a fine
relief of bamboo-trees. The Chinese version was
specially revised for this presentation, in which Christian
Chinese women took the greatest interest. No sooner
had the book been presented than the Emperor sent
an eunuch round to ask for a copy of the same volume.
There was not as yet any copy of quite the same
version, and the one sent was in the course of a few
hours returned with several comments, understood to
be in the Emperors own handwriting, pointing out
the differences, and asking that the same version might
be sent to him. He at the same time applied for
copies of the other books prepared by Europeans for
the instruction of Chinese.</p>

<p>In 1894 he took one of those sudden steps that
a little recall some actions of the German Emperor,
and signified his intention to look over each essay and
poem himself, and place the competitors at the Peking
examination according to their excellence. It may be
imagined what was the astonishment and consternation
of the examining board of high Ministers of State, who
had just examined them, and marked out the standing
of each man according to their own inclinations. There
were two hundred and eight competitors, and it took
the Emperor three whole days to look over the papers.
At the end of that time the list was turned nearly
upside-down, for three men placed amongst the last
by the examining board were now marked out by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
Emperor as among the six entitled to the highest
honours. Amongst the competitors was the lately
returned Minister to the United States, Spain, and
Peru. He had a brevet button of the second rank;
and having lately received the post of Senior Deputy
Supervisor of Instruction to the Heir Apparent, he
had to present himself as a competitor&mdash;notwithstanding
his years and previous services abroad. In the list of
the examining board he stood amongst the first thirty,
and was recommended to a higher post of honour. In
the Emperor's list he was placed in the third class;
and in the decree classifying the essayists, in which the
Emperor stated definitely that he had done so after
himself looking over each paper, this ex-Minister was
ordered to take off his brevet second-rank button,
being degraded from the post of Deputy Supervisor
to that of Junior Secretary of the Supervisorate. There
were many other changes made of the same nature.</p>

<p>Naturally such an action did not tend to establish
the youthful Emperor in the good graces of the more
corrupt of his counsellors. But it showed energy and
initiative, uncommon in Chinamen, also a desire to do
his duty and right wrongs. It is certainly unfortunate
for himself that he did not from the outset set to work
to make to himself friends of the mammon of unrighteousness.
But brought up from his earliest years
as an Emperor, it is not unnatural that he should have
expected all people to bow down before his will as soon
as he asserted it. And it is a little unreasonable to
expect from a young man, palace born and bred, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
never even once had taken a country walk or ride, or
enjoyed liberty of any kind, the character of a Bismarck
or a Napoleon. That his advisers were equally unaware
of the dangers awaiting him is shown by their
having taken no precautions even to save themselves.
It was indeed Kwang-shü who advised Kang to fly
from Peking, not Kang who advised Kwang-shü to be
careful. And that the plot that dethroned the young
Emperor was kept carefully secret is also shown by
the British Minister, a man of experience, and who
has travelled about the world, and is of course amply
provided with all the necessary means for obtaining
information, being actually absent from Peking at the
time, which naturally he never would have been had
he known the crisis was imminent. The German
and American Ministers were also absent, and, more
remarkable still, Sir Robert Hart, Inspector-General of
Chinese Imperial Customs. The moment was indeed
probably chosen in consequence by the Empress.</p>

<p>Surrounded by temptations&mdash;his aunt and adopted
mother is openly accused of having tried to teach
him to take delight in cards and wine, and it is one
of her duties both to select a wife for him and to
surround him with concubines&mdash;the young man seems
to show rather the disposition of an anchorite. All
testimonies agree that he is not of a vigorous physique:
indeed, bred and nurtured as he has been, how could
he be? In health, as in many other ways, he always
recalls to me our own Prince Leopold, the late Duke
of Albany.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span></p>

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that when that very
amiable, gentle-looking young man, now Czar of Russia,
was in China, he and the young Emperor of China
did not meet. Both apparently have aspirations, both
are weighted by a weight of empire no one man can
sustain single-handed, both surrounded by powerful,
unscrupulous men, who will not hesitate to wield their
well-intentioned and apparently sincere nominal rulers to
their own advantage, as also possibly to the destruction
of those nominal sovereigns.</p>

<p>There is a curious tale told that a late Russian
Minister at Peking acquired a great influence over the
Chinese Emperor by speaking to him after this style:
"There are but few countries now that are regulated
in accordance with the principles of decorum. In
England and Germany it is true there are emperors,
but in England it is six-tenths the people's will and
only four-tenths the sovereign's. In Germany it is
rather better: there it is six-tenths the Emperor and
four-tenths the people. As to France and America&mdash;dreadful&mdash;dreadful!
Only China and Russia are
properly constituted countries, where the Emperor
governs and the people obey, according to the will of
Heaven. What friends, then, ought not these two
countries to be, and how terrible for Russia it would be
if China were to fall, for then she would stand alone,
the one properly constituted empire in the world!
Equally, how dreadful it would be for China if Russia
were to fall away! As for us, we cannot feel easy
about China. We remember that after all your Imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
Majesty's is an alien dynasty, governing over a people
of another race, the Chinese, and your capital is so
near the frontier you could easily be pushed over the
border. Your Imperial Majesty should really take precautions
to establish yourself more safely. Now, all
positions of high honour are in the hands of Chinese,
who might easily band together and depose the reigning
dynasty. As each high position falls vacant, Chinese
should be replaced by Manchus; then alone would you
be safely established on the throne of your ancestors,
and Russia could feel safe, knowing China to be so."</p>

<p>Thus and much more. Such conversations can
be easily overheard and repeated by the crowds of
attendants always present at interviews in China. It
was repeated to me in June, 1898. I did not know
if correctly or not. I do not know now. But
for the last year high post after high post has been
conferred upon Manchus, than which no policy could
be more unwise, for it is calculated to exasperate
the Chinese; nor have the Manchus, who have long
ago lost their manliness, living as pensioners of the
Court, any longer the capacity for government.

</div>

<p>In considering the recent bolt from the blue, as it
seemed to the outside world, at Peking, it is
necessary to say a few words more about the Reform
leaders. Kang Yü-wei, commonly called the Modern
Sage, is a Cantonese. He has brought out a new
edition of the ancient Classics, which he contends have
been so glossed over by numbers of commentators as
to have lost their original significance. In especial he
says the personality of God was originally clearly stated
in them, that it is the commentators who have hidden
this, and that only by a return to the belief in a living
God can China once more take her proper place among
the nations. He also insists upon the brotherhood of
man. Missionaries, who know him, dwell upon his
learning and enthusiasm. The only British Consul I
have heard speak of him, dwelt rather upon his want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
of practicality, and described him as a visionary of about
forty and impracticable. He saw him, however, at
the most agitating moment of his career, during his
flight from Peking. When it is considered that he is
a man of not large means, who has no official post,
who must have devoted his time mainly to study to
have passed the examinations he has and revised the
Classics, and that at this comparatively early age he
is the undoubted leader of the army of youthful literati
of China, a man in whom those I have spoken with
seem to have unbounded confidence, it is clear that this
account of him must be a little overdrawn. Probably
he is not a practical man. But that he has evidently
an extraordinary gift for winning and guiding adherents
cannot be denied. A representative of the <i>China Mail</i>
describes him as "an intelligent-looking Chinese of
medium height, but not of unusually striking appearance.
For a native who does not speak any Western language,
Kang has imbibed a wonderful amount of ideas" [this
is only a rather amusing instance of European superciliousness],
and the impression he left upon his
interviewer was that he has a firmer grasp of the situation
than the majority of his compatriots. It may
be considered that some of his views are those of a
visionary, but there can be no doubt of his earnestness;
and it must be borne in mind that there never yet
was a reformer in any country whose views were not
at first believed to be outside the range of practical
politics. For those who are interested in the present
crisis in China, it is better to give the <i>China Mail's</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>
interview with Kang Yü-wei, to be followed by his
own open letter to the papers.</p>

<p>"Before proceeding with the interview, Kang wished
to thank the British people for the kind protection
they had afforded him, and for the interest the English
people were taking in the advancement of the political
and social status of China and the emancipation of the
Emperor. He also wished to explain that the reason
why he had not consented to an interview before was
that he was very much distressed upon learning that
his brother had been decapitated and that the Emperor
was reported to be murdered. The excitement and
anxiety of the past fortnight had unnerved him, and
he was disinclined to see any one or to discuss the
events which had led up to his flight from Peking.</p>

<p>"After this preliminary statement, Kang Yü-wei
proceeded with his story.</p>

<p>"'You all know,' he said, 'that the Empress-Dowager
is not educated, that she is very conservative,
that she has been very reluctant to give the Emperor
any real power in managing the affairs of the empire.
In the year 1887 it was decided to set aside thirty
million taels for the creation of a navy. After the
battleships <i>Tingyuen</i>, <i>Weiyuen</i>, <i>Chihyuen</i>, <i>Chênyuen</i>,
and <i>Kingyuen</i> had been ordered, and after providing
for their payment, the Empress-Dowager appropriated
the balance of the money for the repair of the Eho
Park Gardens. Later on, when it was decided to set
aside or raise thirty million taels for the construction of
railways, she misappropriated a large portion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
money. The first intention had been to construct the
railway to Moukden, but it was never carried farther
than Shanhai-kuan, the remainder of the money being
used for the decoration of the Imperial Gardens.
Every sensible man knows that railways and a navy
are essential for the well-being of a country. But in
spite of the advice of one or two of her counsellors the
Empress-Dowager refused to carry on these schemes,
and thought only of her personal gratification. She has
been steadily opposed to the introduction of Western
civilisation. She has never seen many outside people&mdash;only
a few eunuchs in the Palace and a few Ministers
of State who have access to her.'</p>

<p>"'Through whom does she conduct the affairs of
State?'</p>

<p>"'Before the Japanese War Li Hung-chang was the
man she had most confidence in. After the war
Li Hung-chang was discarded, and she seemed to
repose most confidence in Prince Kung and Jung Lu.
As a rule, however, she retains absolute control in her
own hands. There is a sham eunuch in the Palace,
who has practically more power than any of the
Ministers. Li Luen-yên is the sham eunuch's name.
He is a native of Chihli. Nothing could be done
without first bribing him. All the Viceroys have got
their official positions through bribing this man, who
is immensely wealthy. Li Hung-chang is not to be
compared with him. Before she handed over the reins
of government to the Emperor, a year or two ago,
the Empress-Dowager used to see many Ministers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
but since then she
has only seen
eunuchs and
officials belonging
to the inner department.
I have
seen her myself.
She is of medium
height and commanding
presence,
rather imperious in
manner. She has
a dark, sallow
complexion, long
almond eyes, high
nose, is fairly intelligent-looking,
and has expressive
eyes.'</p>

<p>"In answer to
a query, 'Who
inspired the new
policy at Peking?'
Kang replied: 'About two years ago two officials,
Chang Lin and Wang Ming-luan, sent a memorial
to the Emperor advising him to take the power
into his own hands, stating that the Empress-Dowager
was only the concubine of his uncle, the
Emperor Hien Fêng; therefore according to Chinese
law she could not be recognised as the proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
Empress-Dowager. The result of this memorial was
that the two officials were dismissed for ever.
They were Vice-Presidents of Boards, one being
a Manchu and the other a Soochow man. The
Emperor recognises that the Empress-Dowager is not
his real mother. Since the Emperor began to display
an interest in affairs of State, the Empress-Dowager has
been scheming his deposition. She used to play cards
with him, and gave him intoxicating drinks, in order to
prevent him from attending to State affairs. For the
greater part of the last two years the Emperor has
been practically a figure-head against his own wishes.
After the occupation of Kiaochou by the Germans, the
Emperor was very furious, and said to the Empress-Dowager,
"Unless I have the power, I will not take
my seat as Emperor; I will abdicate." The result was
that the Empress-Dowager gave in to him to a certain
extent, telling him that he could do as he liked; but
although she said this with her lips her heart was
different.'</p>

<p>"'How do you know this?' asked the interviewer.
'Did you hear it yourself?'"</p>

<p>"Kang's reply was: 'No, I heard it from other
officials.'</p>

<p>"'Who recommended you to the notice of the
Emperor?'</p>

<p>"'I was recommended to the Emperor by Kao
Hsi-tsêng, one of the Censors, a native of Hupeh.
Then Wêng Tung-ho, the Emperor's tutor, who is
supposed to be one of the most conservative officials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
in China, but is not actually so, devoted some attention
to me, and Li Tuan-fên, President of the Board of
Rites. These officials wished to introduce me to the
Emperor, to give me some responsible office, and to
put me beside the Emperor as his adviser. The
Emperor ordered me to hold a conference with the
Ministers of the Tsung-li Yamen. On January 3rd
last the conference took place. All the members of the
Yamen were present; I was received with all respect as
their guest. The conference lasted about three hours.</p>

<p>"'I had to say that everything in China must be
reformed and follow Western civilisation.'</p>

<p>"'How were your suggestions received?'</p>

<p>"'They did not say openly. I could see that the
majority of them were against reform. The Viceroy
Jung Lu made the remark, "Why should we change
the manners and customs of our ancestors?" To this
I replied: "Our ancestors never had a Tsung-li Yamen
[Board to deal with foreigners and foreign affairs].
Is not this a change?" The first thing I suggested
was that China should have a properly constituted
judicial system&mdash;that a foreigner should be engaged
to work conjointly with myself and some others to
revise the laws and the Government administrative
departments. That I hold to be the most important
change. This must be the basis on which all other
changes and reforms must rest. The construction of
railways, the creation of a navy, the revision of the
educational system, every other reform will follow; but
unless we can change the laws and administration all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
other changes will be next to useless. Unfortunately,
the Emperor has been pushing on the other reforms
before preparing the way for them. That has contributed
to bring about the present crisis.</p>

<p>"'The following morning Prince Kung and Wêng
Tung-ho reported the conference to the Emperor.
Prince Kung was against me, although I have heard
it said that he admired my abilities, and thought me
clever and able. But he said of me: "He is talking
nonsense; he speaks about changing the ways of our
ancestors!" Wêng Tung-ho gave my proposals his
support.</p>

<p>"'The outcome of the conference was that I was
ordered by the Emperor to submit my proposals to him
in the form of a memorial. The gist of my memorial
was as follows. I told the Emperor that all the customs
and ways and manners of his ancestors must be renewed.
Nothing could be usefully followed so far as Chinese
history was concerned. I advised the Emperor to
follow in the footsteps of Japan, or in the footsteps of
Peter the Great. As a preliminary step I advised the
Emperor to command all his Ministers of State and
all the high officials in Peking to go before the places
where they worshipped the gods, and also to the
Ancestral Halls, there to make an oath that they were
determined to introduce reforms. My second suggestion
was to have the laws and administration revised; my
third, that he should open a Communication or Despatch
Department, through which any one would be
able to memorialise the Throne. To illustrate what I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
considered lacking in the Chinese system, I pointed out
to the Emperor that the Ministers of the Grand Council
were the tongue, the Viceroys and Governors of Provinces
the hands and feet, the Censors the eyes, and the
Emperor the brain. I said: "You have no heart, no
motive power, no proper law, no means of finding out
the desires and opinions of your people. The responsibility
is too widely diffused; you cannot carry things
through effectively. When you want to know anything,
you refer to your Ministers and Viceroys, who represent
the tongue and feet; but these are not thinking organs&mdash;they
can only act upon orders given them." I advised
the Emperor to select young, intelligent men, well
imbued with Western ideas, to assist in the regeneration
of the empire, irrespective of their position, whether
they were lowly born or of high degree; that they
should confer with the Emperor every day and discuss
the measures for reform, first devoting their energies
to a revision of the laws and administration. The old
officials must be dispensed with. I advised him to
appoint twelve new Departments:&mdash;(1) Law Department;
(2) Treasury; (3) Education (engaging foreign teachers);
(4) Legislative Department; (5) Agriculture; (6) Commercial
Department; (7) Mechanical Department;
(8) Railway Department; (9) Postal; (10) Mining;
(11) Army; (12) Navy,&mdash;all the twelve Departments to
be modelled on Western lines, and foreigners to be
engaged to advise and assist. Throughout the provinces,
in every two prefectures, I suggested the establishment
of a sort of Legislative Council, whose chief duty would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
be to give effect to the instructions of the twelve
Departments, to police the country, to introduce sanitary
measures, to construct roads, to induce the people to
cultivate the land under modern methods, and to spread
commerce. Each of these Councils should have a
President, appointed by the Emperor himself, irrespective
of birth, degree, or position; and each President should
have the liberty to memorialise the Emperor direct,
in the same manner as Viceroys and Governors of the
Provinces, to whom he was not to be subject. In effect
these Presidents were to have the same social rank as
the Viceroys. The President was also to have the
power to recommend a man to go to each district to
co-operate with the gentry and merchant classes in
giving effect to the new reforms. My memorial also
showed how funds were to be raised. I pointed out the
enormous loss of revenue that occurred yearly. Taking
the magistracy of Nanhai (which is my native district),
I informed the Emperor that the total revenue derived
from that district was $240,000 per year, but the actual
amount going into the Imperial Purse was only something
over $20,000. I recommended a complete change
of the system, under which the whole of the revenues
of the country would go into the Imperial Purse.
Comparing China with India, and adducing from the
experience of India the financial resources of China,
I told the Emperor that from ordinary taxes the sum
of four hundred million taels could be raised annually,
and if the <i>likin</i> were abolished and a tariff properly
adjusted, banknotes issued, stamp duty established, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
other financial reforms adopted, at least another three
hundred million taels could be raised, making in all
seven hundred million taels. With this money in hand
it would be an easy thing to get a navy to protect our
coast and to establish naval colleges for the training
of officers. State railways could also be constructed
and other necessary reforms effected.</p>

<p>"'I was told that the Emperor was highly pleased,
and said that he had never seen a better memorial nor
such a good system as I proposed. He recommended
the memorial to the consideration of the Tsung-li Yamen
for report. Prince Kung, Jung Lu, and Hsü Ying-kuei
were against it; but the Emperor pressed for a reply,
which was never given in detail. All the Ministers
would report was that the memorial was so sweeping,
that it practically meant the abolition of the present
great Ministers, and therefore they did not like to
report upon it themselves. You will have seen in the
newspapers that the Emperor had already adopted many
of the recommendations contained in my memorial.</p>

<p>"'I also sent to the Emperor two books written
by myself, one entitled <i>The Reform of Japan</i> and the
other <i>The Reform of Russia by Peter the Great</i>.
Subsequently I sent another memorial, advising the
Emperor to be determined and not to dally with the
proposals for reform.</p>

<p>"'To this memorial the Emperor replied with an
Edict. On June 16th I was granted an audience with
the Emperor. It lasted for two hours. I was received
at 5 a.m. in the Jênshow Throne-hall. Port Arthur and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
Talienwan had just been taken over by Russia, and the
Emperor wore an anxious, careworn expression. The
Emperor was thin, but apparently in good health. He
has a straight nose, round forehead, pleasant eyes, is
clean-shaven, and has a pale complexion. He is of
medium height. His hands are long and thin. He
looked very intelligent, and had a kindly expression,
altogether uncommon amongst the Manchus or even
amongst the Chinese. He wore the usual official dress,
but instead of the large square of embroidery on the
breast worn by the high officials the embroidery in his
case was round, encircling a dragon, and there were two
smaller embroideries on his shoulders. He wore the
usual official cap. He was led in by eunuchs, and took
his seat on a dais on a large yellow cushion, with his
feet folded beneath him. He sent his attendants away,
and we were left alone; but all the time we were conversing
his eyes were watching the windows, as if to see
that no one was eavesdropping. There was a long table
in front of him with two large candlesticks. I knelt
at one of the corners of the table, and not on the
cushions in front of the table which are reserved for
the high officials. I remained kneeling during the
whole of the audience. We conversed in the Mandarin
dialect.</p>

<p>"'The Emperor said to me: "Your books are very
useful and very instructive."</p>

<p>"'I practically repeated what I said in my memorial
about the weakness of China being owing to the lack
of progress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span></p>

<p>"'The Emperor said: "Yes, all these Conservative
Ministers have ruined me."</p>

<p>"'I said to him, "China is very weak now, but it is
not yet too late to amend." I gave him the example of
France after the Franco-Prussian War. In that case
the indemnity was much greater than China has paid to
Japan. The territory lost was greater, because France
had lost two provinces and China had only lost one
(Formosa). I asked him how it was that France had
been able to recuperate so rapidly, whereas China had
done practically nothing during the three years since the
close of the war.</p>

<p>"'The Emperor listened very attentively, and asked
me to give the reason.</p>

<p>"'I replied that the reason was that M. Thiers issued
proclamations to the people of France advising the
abolition of corrupt methods and asking their co-operation
for the rehabilitation of the country, at once
instituting reforms which would enable the country to
recover the ground it had lost. The outcome was that
the whole population of France was as one man working
for one single object. Hence its quick recovery. In
China, however, we have still the old Conservative
Ministers, who put every obstruction in the way of
reform; and I told the Emperor that that was the main
reason why the country was now in its present sad
condition, worse off than it was three years ago, at the
close of the China-Japan War.</p>

<p>"'I asked him to look at the difficulties Japan had
to overcome before she could reform on modern lines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
There the military or feudal party had more power than
our present Conservative Ministers, but the Mikado
adopted the proper course by selecting young and
intelligent men, junior officials, some of whom he set to
work out the reforms in the country, whilst others went
abroad to learn foreign methods, and returned to make
Japan the powerful country which it is to-day. I
repeated to him what Peter the Great did to make
Russia powerful, saying, "You, the Emperor, I would
ask you to remove yourself from the seclusion in which
you live. Come boldly forward and employ young and
intelligent officials. Follow in the footsteps of the three
rulers of whom I have spoken to you, and you will find
that the reforms will be more easily carried out than you
at present imagine. In case China is unable to produce
a sufficient number of intelligent men to give effect to the
reforms you initiate, I strongly advocate the employment
of foreigners, particularly Englishmen and Americans."</p>

<p>"'I said to him: "You must cut your coat according
to your cloth,' and advised him to approach the matter
carefully and deliberately. To illustrate what I meant, I
pointed out that if he wished to build a palace he must
obtain plans, then buy the bricks to build the palace
according to design. "You may be told that China has
reformed during the last few years. In my opinion
nothing has been reformed. China has simply done
what I have advised you not to do. She has been
buying bricks to build a house before deciding on the
plan or design; she is attempting to make a big coat out
of an insufficient quantity of cloth." I told the Emperor:
"Your present Government is just like a building with
a leaky roof; the joists are rotten and have been eaten
by white ants. It is absolutely dangerous to remain
longer in the building. Not only must you take off the
roof, but you must take down the whole building, and
even raze the foundation. How could you expect your
present old Ministers to reform? They have never had
any Western education. They have never studied
anything thoroughly about Western civilisation, and
they could not study now if you asked them. They
have no energy left. To instruct them to carry out
reforms is like asking your cook to become your tailor,
your tailor to become your cook, or your barber to
become your chair-coolie and your chair-coolie to shave
you. The result of that would be that you would not
get a good coat, you would get nothing good to eat,
your head would be hacked. Your Majesty is careful
to select a proper tailor, a proper cook, a proper barber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span>
and a proper chair-coolie. But in the administration of
your empire, which is far more important, you do not
take so much care as in your own personal affairs."</p>

<p>"'To this the Emperor replied: "I am very sorry; I
have practically no power to remove any high Ministers.
The Empress-Dowager wants to reserve this power in
her own hands.'</p>

<p>"'I said: "If your Majesty has no power to remove
Ministers, what you can do is to employ young and
intelligent officials about you. That would be a step
better than nothing."</p>

<p>"'The Emperor said: "I know it perfectly well that all
the Ministers have paid no proper attention to Western
ideas and do not care to study the progress of the world."</p>

<p>"'I said to the Emperor: "Perhaps it is their wish
to get a knowledge of Western ideas, but they have too
much to do under the present system, and they are
much too old. Their energy is gone. Even if they
are willing they cannot do it. The chief education of
China in the study of the Classics is useless, and the
first thing the Emperor must do is to abolish these
examinations and establish a system of education on the
lines of Western countries." I asked the Emperor:
"Can you do away with this kind of examination?"</p>

<p>"'The Emperor said: "I have realised that whatever
is learned in Western countries is useful, but whatever is
learned in China is practically useless, and I will carry
out your recommendations"; which he did. I advised
the Emperor to send his own relations to travel in
foreign countries in order to learn from them, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
he might be surrounded by men who had experience of
the world. In conclusion, I said: "There are many
other things I should like to say, but I can memorialise
you from time to time." I advised him strongly to
cement his relations with foreign countries.</p>

<p>"'The Emperor replied that the foreign countries
nowadays were not like the insignificant states of former
times. They appeared to be highly civilised countries,
and it was a pity his own Ministers did not realise that
as he did. A good deal of the trouble seemed to arise
from their failure to recognise this fact.</p>

<p>"'In December last I had advised his Majesty to
form an alliance with Great Britain. Before parting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
I said to him: "You have given decorations to Li
Hung-chang and Chang Yin-huan. That is a Western
act. Why do not you put in your Edicts that you intend
to introduce Western customs?"</p>

<p>"'The Emperor only smiled.</p>

<p>"'From June until I left Peking, I have sent many
memorials to the Emperor, but have never had another
audience. I was allowed to memorialise him direct.
This is the first time in the present dynasty that an
individual in my position has been allowed to memorialise
the Throne direct.'</p>

<p>"In answer to a question, Kang stated that Chang
Yin-huan was not associated with him in the proposed
reforms. He was pleased with the programme of the
Reformers, but he did not take any active part in promoting
the reforms. All the men arrested were junior
officials in the various secretariats in Peking, all interested
in reform.</p>

<p>"Asked when the first symptoms of trouble appeared,
Kang stated that the signs of opposition were raised
when the Emperor issued his Edict dismissing two
Presidents and four Vice-Presidents. One of these
Presidents is a relative of the Empress-Dowager&mdash;Huai
Ta-pu, President of the Board of Rites. On the following
day Li Hung-chang and Ching Hsin were removed
from the Tsung-li Yamen. These dismissed officials
went in a body and knelt before the Empress-Dowager
and asked for her assistance, saying that if she allowed
the Emperor to go on in this way the whole of the old
officials would soon be dismissed. Then these officials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span>
went to Tientsin and saw Jung Lu, who may be said
to be the best friend of the Empress-Dowager.
Rumours got about that the Emperor intended to dispose
of the Empress-Dowager, and she then determined
that Jung Lu should take the first step. That was on
or about September 14th or 15th. On September 17th
an open Edict was issued by the Emperor, asking why
Kang Yü-wei was still in Peking and did not proceed
to Shanghai at once to attend to the establishment of
the official organ. 'That was a hint to me to go away.
An Edict of this sort is generally issued to a Viceroy
or a Chief General, and not to men of my rank. The
morning I saw this Edict I was highly astonished. On
that evening a special private message was sent to me
by the Emperor. The message was sent in writing.
Part of it appeared in the <i>China Mail</i> last night. I
happened to be out, and did not receive the message
till the morning of September 18th.</p>

<p>"'On the morning of the 18th I received two special
messages from the Emperor, one dated September 16th
and the other September 17th. The first one read:</p>

<p>"'"We know that the empire is in very troublous
times. Unless we adopt Western methods it is impossible
to save our empire; unless we remove the old-fashioned
Conservative Ministers and put in their stead
young and intelligent men, possessed of a knowledge
of Western affairs, it is impossible to carry out the
reforms we had intended. But the Empress-Dowager
does not agree with me: I have repeatedly advised
her Majesty, but she becomes enraged. Now I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
afraid I shall not be able to protect my throne. You
are hereby commanded to consult your colleagues and
see what assistance you can give to save me. I am
very anxious and distressed. I am anxiously waiting
for your assistance. Respect this."</p>

<p>"'The second message was as follows: "I have
commanded you to superintend the establishment of
the official organ. It is strongly against my wish. I
have very great sorrow in my heart, which cannot be
described with pen and ink. You must proceed at once
outside (abroad), and devise means to save me without
a moment's delay. I am deeply affected with your
loyalty and faithfulness. Please take great care of your
health and body. I hope that before long you will be
able to assist me again in reorganising my empire, and
to put everything upon a proper basis. This is my
earnest wish."</p>

<p>"'After I received these letters, I had a meeting with
my colleagues as to the best thing to be done. I saw
Mr. Timothy Richard, the English missionary, and
asked him to see the British Minister at once. Unfortunately
Sir Claude Macdonald was at Pehtaiho.
Then I sent to the American Legation, but was told
that the American Minister had gone to the Western
Hills. If Sir Claude Macdonald had been at the
British Legation, I believe measures could have been
devised to avoid this crisis.</p>

<p>"'In the city everything was quiet. There was no
sign of an impending crisis. Nobody anticipated trouble;
nobody was in fear of his life. On the 19th I heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a></span>
from my friends that the position was getting more
serious. Up to this time I had remained in my
quarters in the Canton Club. At four o'clock on
the morning of the 20th I left the city, passing
through the gates, leaving all my baggage behind in
the care of my brother. I retained a compartment in
the railway carriage, and travelled direct to Tangku by
rail. At Tientsin I boarded the Indo-China steamer
<i>Lienshing</i> and asked for a cabin. When the people
on board saw I had so little baggage they said: "You
must go and get a ticket at the office before we can
allow you to come on board." I went back to Tientsin
again and went into an hotel&mdash;not an hotel of my own
countrymen, but the hotel of another province. I had
been advised to shave my moustache off and to change
my dress, but I left myself to fate. I stayed overnight
at Tientsin, and early in the morning went on board
the <i>Chungking</i>. I had to go as an ordinary Chinese
passenger, because I was afraid if I asked for a cabin
I should again be refused a passage on account of the
absence of baggage. Mr. Timothy Richard offered me
an asylum at his house, but as I had received instructions
from the Emperor to proceed abroad I thought it best
to leave the capital. I got no letter from the British
Legation; I had no communication with the British
Legation. The steamer called at Chefoo, where nothing
unusual happened. When I arrived at Woosung, the
British Consul was kind enough to offer me a place
of safety on board H.M.S. <i>Esk</i>. I believe Mr. Richard
must have gone to the Legation at Peking, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a></span>
instructions were given to the British Consul to be on
the look-out for me. I was surprised at this, but I am
very grateful to Messrs. Brenan and Bourne (British
Consuls) and to the captain of the ship for the kindness
they showed to me during my stay at Woosung.'</p>

<p>"'What do you intend to do?'</p>

<p>"'The Emperor has instructed me to go abroad and
procure assistance for him. My intention is to approach
England in the first instance. England is well known
to be the most just nation in the world. England has
twice saved Turkey, once at the sacrifice of twenty
thousand men and a large sum of money, and I think
England will come to the assistance of the Emperor
of China now. While I was in Shanghai, I requested
the British Consul to wire to the Foreign Office at
home asking for this assistance to his Majesty. Personally,
I think it is to England's interest to take this
opportunity to support the Emperor and the party of
progress, for by so doing they will be helping the
people of China as well, and the people of China
will consider England as their best and truest friend.
If England does not take steps now, I am afraid that
when the Siberian Railway is finished Russian influence
will predominate throughout the whole of China. If
England succeeds in replacing the Emperor on the
throne, I have no hesitation in saying that the Emperor
and the Reform leaders will not forget her kindness.
When I left Peking, the Emperor was still in good
health.'</p>

<p>"Before leaving Kang was asked if he had anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span>
further to add to the interview&mdash;anything he had
forgotten.</p>

<p>"He replied: 'I should like it to be stated that when
I saw the Emperor I said I did not go to Peking for
money or position. I simply went there to try to do
my best to save the four hundred millions of China.
I told him I would not take any high position until I
had been instrumental in carrying through the proposals
for reform I had made to him; then I would accept
anything his Majesty was pleased to give me. Had
he given me position then, it would simply have created
jealousy among the old Ministers; besides, I did not
feel that I had done anything to warrant such elevation.
The Emperor was good enough to send me
two thousand taels as a special reward&mdash;a thing, I
believe, which has never been done in the history of
the present dynasty.'</p>

<p>"The interview concluded with a request on the part
of Kang to urge the English people to take steps for
the protection of the relatives of Liang, who had been
arrested by the officials in the district of Canton. These
relatives, we understand, consist of his foster-mother,
aunt, uncle, brother, and his nephew and two others."</p>

TOWN OF WEI-HAI-WEI IN DISTANCE.<br />
<i>By Mr. Stratford Dugdale.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This interview was on October 7th. It was on
September 22nd that Kang's six colleagues had been
summarily beheaded in Peking. Three were members
of the Hanlin College, the highest body in China&mdash;namely,
Lin Hsio, Yang, and Lin Kuang-ti. One was
a Censor&mdash;Yang. The others were Kang's younger
brother, and Tan Tze-tung, son of the ex-Governor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span>
of Hupeh. It is Tan who went to his death saying,
"They may kill my body, but my spirit will live in
the lives of others," and again, "My country will yet
be freed from the tyrants that now enthral her in their
grasp of ignorance and corruption."</p>

<p>A newspaper correspondent wrote from Hupeh:
"Nothing but sympathy is felt for poor old Tan, our
ex-Governor, the father of Tan Tze-tung, who was
beheaded in Peking. It is said that for a long time the
news of his son's death was kept from him, and was
finally told him by our Viceroy, Chang-chih-tung himself,
when the latter went on board his ship to bid him
farewell on his departure from Wuchang." And again,
a few days later: "Our late Governor, H.E. Tan, is
reported dead. The native story is that he took the
execution of his son at Peking and his own degradation
so much to heart, that he committed suicide on his way
home."</p>

<p>It is related that none of the victims conducted
themselves otherwise than as heroes, excepting only
the Censor, who was so utterly astounded at the fate
befalling him as to plead with his executioners. He
had never known Kang, said he had taken part in no
plot, and wept bitterly as he was hurried through the
streets. It is related also that all were given decent
burial with the exception of Kang's own young
brother, whose body no man dared touch.</p>

<p>Kang Yü-wei's ancestral home is in the small village
of Fangchun, right opposite the walls of Canton City,
and separated from it by the Pearl River. Late on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a></span>
the night of September 23rd the quiet village was all
excitement at the sudden disappearance of all the
members of Kang's clan, leaving no trace of their
whereabouts. Explanations came, however, the next
morning, when a force of runners from the district
magistrate made their appearance in the village, and,
surrounding the old Kang homestead, began searching
for the inmates. Only four persons were found in the
place, consisting of farm-hands, and these were taken
across the river into the city by the runners for want
of more important prisoners.</p>

<p>Kang's uncle, who kept a large grain shop in
Canton, had a narrow escape from arrest, the warning
to get away arriving only a few minutes before the
police made their appearance, while his employés also
got away in the nick of time. The premises were
then sealed up, as also was the ancestral hall of the
Kang clan in their native village of Fangchun. A
flourishing school established by Kang in the old
city temple of Canton was also sealed by the local
authorities, but fortunately for the twenty-odd scholars
there they received warning and escaped before the
<i>yamen</i> runners made their appearance.</p>

<p>Mr. Liang, the editor of <i>Chinese Progress</i>, was
warned by Kang in time to fly himself, but four of
his relatives had been captured. It was under the
agitation of all these events that Kang Yü-wei wrote
the following letter, which only one Chinese newspaper
had the courage to publish. Perhaps, considering what
has followed, it is kinder to suppress its name.

<p class="center p2">AN OPEN LETTER FROM KANG YÜ-WEI.</p>

<p class="i2">
"<span class="smcap">Respected Seniors</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The overpowering calamity which fell from
Heaven on the fatal 5th day of the 8th moon
(20th September), bringing such unexpected and fearful
changes over the empire by the usurpation of the
Imperial power by the antitype of those vile and
licentious ancient Empresses Lü and Wu, followed by
the deposition and imprisonment of our true Sovereign,
causing thereby heaven and earth to change places and
obliterating the lights of the sun and moon from his
Majesty's loyal subjects, have, I know, filled with
universal indignation the hearts of the people.</p>

<p>"Our youthful Emperor's intelligence and enthusiasm
made him bend his energies to inaugurate new measures
of reform for the country, to be put into practice in
due time one after the other, and all who owed his
Majesty loyalty and allegiance learning this raised our
hands to our heads with pleasure and danced with joy.
The False One [or Usurper] attempted to introduce
avarice and licentiousness into the Palace, in order to
tempt our Sovereign to destruction; but his Majesty
spurned them with scorn, and these evils were unable
to defile the Palace atmosphere. Then one or two
traitors of the Conservative element, finding their objects
prevented, threw themselves prostrate around the
Usurper and besought her to resume the reins of power.
(<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Owing to the cashiering of Huai Ta-pu,
President of the Board of Rites, and his colleagues,
Huai and Jung Lu were at the bottom of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">596</a></span>
plot.) The False One then, contrary to all rights of
heaven and earth, seized the reins of power and
issued a forged edict calling for physicians for his
Majesty, thereby foreshadowing that the Emperor
would be poisoned. To-day, therefore, we know not
whether his Majesty be alive or dead. This indeed
is that which makes gods and men indignant and feel
that heaven and earth will never pardon nor allow such
to triumph long.</p>

<p>"This Usurper, when she came into power in former
years, poisoned the Eastern Empress-Consort of Hien
Fêng; she murdered with poisoned wine the Empress
of Tung Chih; and by her acts made the late Emperor
Hien Fêng die of spleen and indignation. And now
she has dared to depose and imprison our true
Sovereign. Her crime is great and extreme in its
wickedness. There has never been a worse deed.
Although the writer, your humble servant, and Lin,
Yang, Tan, and Liu [four of the six martyrs] all received
his Majesty's commands in his last extremity, we, alas!
have not the power and strength of Hsü Chin-yi [who
restored the Emperor Tsung-chung to the throne after
deposing the Empress Wu Tsêh-tien of the T`ang
Dynasty], but can only emulate the example of Shên
Pao-sü in weeping. [This was a minister of Ts`u
(Hunan), who over two thousand years ago went weeping
to beseech the powerful King of Chin (Shensi) to
avenge the deposition of his master the King of Ts`u,
and by his importunity succeeded in carrying his point.]</p>

<p>"I, therefore, now send you copies of his Majesty's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
two secret edicts to me, and crave your assistance in
publishing them to the whole world either in the
Chinese or foreign newspapers. This will, I earnestly
trust, bring strong arms to our Sovereign's rescue. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">598</a></span>
Majesty has always accepted the fiat of his ancestors
in recognising the mother who bore him as his own
mother, and not an Imperial concubine as his mother.
The False One in relation to the Emperor Tung Chih
was the latter's mother; but as regards his Majesty
Kwang-shü, our Sovereign, she is but a former
Emperor's concubine-relict [Hien Fêng's]. According
to the tenets of the <i>Spring and Autumn Records</i> (written
by Confucius), although Queen Wên Chiang was the
mother of King Chuang of Lu, yet that did not
save her from being imprisoned by her own son on
account of her licentious conduct; much more in the
present case, then, should punishment be administered
to one who was but merely a Palace concubine. What
right had this woman to depose our bright and sagacious
Emperor? If this could be clearly set forth in
the Chinese and foreign newspapers and be published
to the world, I verily believe that from Peking to
Yunnan and the sixteen ancient divisions of China
some hero must surely arise to avenge our Sovereign.
With my humble compliments,</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">It is hardly necessary to comment upon the extreme
pathos of the letters of this young man of twenty-seven,
for twenty-three years nominal Emperor of
China, but now, at the first attempt to take the power
into his own hands, summarily deposed. It is believed
that it was his attempt to summon soldiery to his aid
that led to the Empress's <i>coup d'état</i>. Some say the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">599</a></span>
Reform party were advising that the Empress-Dowager
should be asked to retire to a palace in the country.</p>

<p>"The following is the list of the proposed 'Council
of Ten' who were to have assembled daily in the
Maoching Throne-hall to advise the Emperor on reform
measures, as given by the <i>Sinwênpao</i>:</p>

<p>"1. Li Tuan-fên (President of the Board of Rites
to be President of the Council).</p>

<p>"2. Hsü Chih-ching (Senior Reader of the Hanlin
Academy, and at the time of his disgrace acting Vice-President
of the Board of Rites).</p>

<p>"3. Kang Yü-wei (Junior Secretary of the Board of
Works and a Secretary of the Tsung-li Yamen).</p>

<p>"4. Yang Shen-hsiu (Censor of the Kiangnan
Circuit).</p>

<p>"5. Sung Peh-lu (Censor of the Shantung Circuit).</p>

<p>"6. Hsü Jên-chu (Literary Chancellor of Hunan).</p>

<p>"7. Chang Yuan-chi (Hanlin Compiler).</p>

<p>"8. Liang Chi-chao (M.A., ex-editor of <i>Chinese
Progress</i>).</p>

<p>"9. Kang Kuang-jên (M.A., and younger brother of
Kang Yü-wei).</p>

<p>"10. Hsü Jên-ching (Hanlin Bachelor, son of Hsü
Chih-ching and brother of Hsü Jên-chu).</p>

<p>"With reference to the punishments meted out to
the above-noted ten: (1) Li Tuan-fên was cashiered
and banished to Kashgaria for ever; (2) Hsü Chih-ching,
imprisoned in the dungeons of the Board of
Punishments for life; (3) Kang Yü-wei, proscribed
and ordered to be sliced to pieces at moment of capture;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>
his family to suffer death, together with his uncles,
aunts, and cousins, and their ancestral graves to be
razed; (4) Vang Shen-hsiu, one of the Martyred Six;
(5) Sung Peh-lu, disappeared the day he was cashiered
and dismissed for ever&mdash;September 23rd&mdash;but is reported
to have been captured afterwards while travelling
overland for the South; (6) Hsü Jên-chu, cashiered
and dismissed for ever; (7) Chang Yuan-chi, a man of
great wealth, also cashiered and dismissed for ever;
(8) Liang Chi-chao, proscribed and now a refugee in
Japan; (9) Kang Kuang-jên, one of the Martyred
Six; and (10) Hsü Jên-ching, also cashiered and dismissed
for ever. As for Li and Hsü, the first and
second of the list given above, their place would also
have been by the side of the Martyred Six on the fatal
evening of the 28th ultimo, had they not been aged
men, high in rank.</p>

<p>"It is reported from reliable sources at Peking
that on the day of the Empress-Dowager's <i>coup d'état</i>
(September 22nd) no less than fourteen eunuchs who
were the Emperor's own personal attendants, and on
whose devotion he was in the habit of relying, were
ordered to execution by the Empress-Dowager. The
reason given why this sanguinary deed has not become
widely known is that the executions took place in the
courtyard of the chief eunuch's office, inside the Palace
grounds, where refractory and rebellious eunuchs are
always attended to, unknown to the outside world."</p>

<p>It is not surprising that, according to the Peking
correspondent of the <i>Sinwênpao</i>, in October, 1898, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span>
great fear of some impending disaster seemed to have
fallen over the capital, and numbers of houses had the
words "<i>Speak not of State Affairs</i>" written on slips of
red paper posted over the lintels of each household;
the idea being that something must have very recently
happened in the Palace at Eho Park, which the powers
that be desired to keep secret from the world for the
time being.</p>

<p>The railway had been crowded the past week with
officials from the provinces returning to their homes.
They were afraid to remain where every word they
uttered was liable to be considered treason. When they
reached their homes, we may expect their reports to
their friends and adherents would not increase their
loyalty to the Manchu Dynasty.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all this, people are surprised
that the young man of twenty-seven, without funds,
without an army, did not assert himself more. The
silence of Kwang-shü is perhaps the noblest action of
a much-enduring life.</p>

<p>There was a pathetic story current in Peking that
he contrived once to escape from his prison in the
island at the Southern Lakes, Eho Park, where he
had been confined by the Empress-Dowager since the
<i>coup d'état</i>; but that when he got to the Park gates,
the Imperial guards, all creatures of the Empress-Dowager,
shut the great gates in his face. A crowd
of eunuchs, who dared not offer his person any violence
or attempt to use force in preventing his walking to
the Park gates, followed him in a body, and upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
gates being closed they all knelt in front of the Emperor
beseeching him with tears to have mercy on them and
not attempt to escape, for it would mean the death
of all of them as well as of the guardsmen at the
gates were he to do so. The guardsmen also <i>k`otowed</i>
and joined in the general prayer, while on the other
hand they sent one of their number to apprise the
Empress-Dowager of the matter. The Emperor finally
took pity on his suppliant subjects, and quietly returned
to his prison.</p>

<p>To Europeans this may seem too strange to be
true; to those who know China it is so Chinese as to
seem probable. That an Emperor should be moved
by the tears of his subjects is what Chinese would
expect.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Kang escaped through
the intervention of British Consuls, by the protection
of a British man-of-war, and was lodged for safety
in the gaol at Hongkong at first. Thence he proceeded
to Japan, where other Chinese reformers had
preceded him, under Japanese protection. The <i>North
China Herald</i> of October 3rd, 1898, publishes the
following tribute of gratitude from the fellow-provincials
of Kang Yü-wei to the Consuls, Admiral, and
people of the "Great Empire of Great Britain," for
saving Kang from the clutches of the opponents of
reform, purporting to represent the sentiments of
the Shanghai Cantonese:&mdash;The contents of the post
envelope were (1) a red card with the words, "Presented
with bowed heads by the people of Kwangtung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a></span>
(Canton) Province"; (2) another red card bearing the
words, "The people of Kwangtung Province reverentially
beg to present their united thanks to the people
of the great, unequalled Empire of Great Britain for
this proof of loyalty, kindness, majesty, courage, and
love of strict justice"; and (3) a sheet of letter paper
containing the words, "We, the people of Kwangtung
Province, crave permission to express our deep gratitude
to their Excellencies the Consuls and the Admiral of
the Great Empire of Great Britain for their great
kindness to us.</p>

<p class="i2 p2">
"Reverentially presented by the people of Kwangtung
Province.</p>

<p>"We further beg the editor of the <i>North China
Daily News</i> to give publicity to the above in its
valuable columns, and hope personally to give thanks
therefor."</p>

<p>Since then, on October 31st, 1898, the following
memorial was presented to the British Consul-General,
Mr. Brenan. He could not, as an official, receive it,
but the pathetic document cannot but be read with
interest.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The avarice and extortions of the mandarins
of China and their underlings were the cause of the
Emperor's estrangement from his people; and it was
this estrangement that has led to his present weakness
and their distress.</p>

<p>"Recognising the need for reform, the Emperor in
his wisdom and good judgment began, during the
fifth moon of the present year, to issue edicts, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">604</a></span>
for their object the complete renovation of the Empire.
The main subjects dealt with were as follows:</p>

<p>"1. The substitution of men of modern ideas and
learning for old and useless officials.</p>

<p>"2. The establishment of colleges and technical
schools for the advancement of scientific knowledge,
after the most approved methods of Western nations.</p>

<p>"3. Conferring the right to memorialise the Throne
direct upon all officials throughout the empire, without
distinction of rank.</p>

<p>"4. The abrogation of the classical essay system of
examinations for degrees and offices.</p>

<p>"The above edicts caused much rejoicing among
the people, who recognised in them a great power for
the immediate uplifting of the empire, and its future
prosperity.</p>

<p>"We, your memorialists, are firmly convinced that
if the reforms embodied in the Imperial Edicts could
have been put into operation for twenty or thirty years,
great and beneficial changes would have been brought
about, which would have resulted in the entire change
of the customs of the land, and establishment of better
relations with the West. Thus we could have looked
forward confidently to the inauguration of an era of
universal peace.</p>

<p>"But now, through the machinations of evil men
and the short-sighted policy of the Empress-Dowager,
our Emperor has been imprisoned, the lives of many
faithful officers have been ruthlessly taken, and all the
Imperial Edicts calling for reform have been revoked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a></span>
All educational societies have been interdicted, and the
native newspapers have been suppressed. Moreover,
the lives of all those favourable to reform are in the
gravest danger.</p>

<p>"We, your memorialists, being loyal Chinese subjects,
regard with great indignation such unwarrantable
action on the part of the Empress-Dowager; but we
have no power to rectify this unhappy state of affairs.</p>

<p>"Therefore we pray you, sir, according to that
equity which is recognised among all nations, to pity
China in her distress, by sending a cablegram to the
Government, urging your people to assist us by restoring
the Emperor to his rightful throne, and by filling the
offices of State with faithful and enlightened men.</p>

<p>"Thus will the renovation of China be due to the
favour of your Sovereign Ruler, and to you, sir, who
forwarded the memorial.</p>

<p>"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Chinese officialdom is at present divided
into two classes, the old and new&mdash;Conservatives and
Reformers. The former have placed their reliance
on Russia to help them, in return for which Russia
will gain enlarged territory. The Reformers look to
Great Britain and the United States for help, knowing
that the policy of these two nations is to keep the
Chinese Empire intact. Should the reactionists triumph
in their present schemes, there is no power that will
prevent the division of China among all the nations of
the earth. The Reformers have no power. They can
only weep at their country's distress, while they present
this memorial asking for your honourable country's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span>
assistance. The first thing to be done is to liberate the
Emperor and to restore him to power, and to remove
the Empress-Dowager. A proclamation from the
Emperor calling his people to his protection would
be loyally responded to by all his faithful subjects
throughout the land.</p>

<p class="p2">An attempt has been made to show that the Reform
party, with the young Emperor Kwang-shü at their
head, brought on themselves all that has happened by
urging foolish reforms, and moving too fast. A slight
summary of the Emperor's decrees will show that all
he had done was for China's good.</p>

<p><i>June 13th, 1898.</i>&mdash;The Emperor issued a decree
commanding the establishment of a University at Peking,
and also ordered Kang Yü-wei to appear at a special
audience.</p>

<p><i>June 15th.</i>&mdash;He dismissed his tutor, Wêng Tung-ho,
and announced his intention of sending some of the
Imperial Clansmen and Princes to travel abroad and
learn.</p>

<p><i>June 20th.</i>&mdash;He ordered the Tsung-li Yamen to
report on the necessity of encouraging art, science, and
modern agriculture. It was ordered that the construction
of the Lu-han railway should be expedited.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">609</a></span></p>

<p><i>June 23rd.</i>&mdash;The classical essays were abolished as
a necessary part of examinations.</p>

<p><i>June 27th.</i>&mdash;The Ministers and Princes were ordered
to report on the proposal to adopt Western arms and
drill for all the Tartar troops.</p>

<p><i>July 4th.</i>&mdash;The establishment of agricultural schools
in the provinces to teach the farmers improved methods
of agriculture was commanded; and on the same day
the liberal-minded Sun Chia-nai was appointed President
of the Peking University.</p>

<p><i>July 5th.</i>&mdash;The Emperor ordered the introduction
of patent and copyright laws.</p>

<p><i>July 6th.</i>&mdash;The Board of War and the Tsung-li
Yamen were ordered to report on the proposed reform
of military examinations.</p>

<p><i>July 7th.</i>&mdash;Special rewards were promised to
inventors and authors.</p>

<p><i>July 14th.</i>&mdash;Officials were ordered to do all in their
power to encourage trade and assist merchants.</p>

<p><i>July 29th.</i>&mdash;On the recommendation of Li Tuan-fên,
since banished to Kashgaria by the Empress Tze Hsi,
the establishment of educational boards was ordered in
every city throughout the empire.</p>

<p><i>August 2nd.</i>&mdash;The Bureau of Mines and Railways
was established.</p>

<p><i>August 9th.</i>&mdash;Journalists were encouraged to write on
political subjects for the enlightenment of the authorities.</p>

<p><i>August 10th.</i>&mdash;Jung Lu and Lin Kun-yi were
directed to consult on the establishment of naval
academies and training-ships.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a></span></p>

<p><i>August 22nd.</i>&mdash;It was ordered that schools should
be established in connection with Chinese Legations
abroad, for the benefit of the sons of Chinese settled in
foreign countries.</p>

<p><i>August 24th.</i>&mdash;Ministers and Provincial Authorities
were urged to assist the Emperor in his work of reform.</p>

<p><i>August 28th.</i>&mdash;The Viceroys Lin Kun-yi and Chang-chih-tung
were ordered to establish commercial bureaux
for the encouragement of trade in Shanghai and
Hankow.</p>

<p><i>September 1st.</i>&mdash;Six minor and useless boards in
Peking were abolished.</p>

<p><i>September 7th.</i>&mdash;Li Hung-chang and Ching Hsin
were dismissed from the Tsung-li Yamen, and the issue
of <i>chao-hsin</i> bonds was stopped, because the provincial
authorities had used them to squeeze the people.</p>

<p><i>September 8th.</i>&mdash;The governorships of Hupeh,
Kwangtung, and Yunnan were abolished as a useless
expense.</p>

<p><i>September 11th.</i>&mdash;The establishment of schools of
instruction in the preparation of tea and silk was
approved.</p>

<p><i>September 12th.</i>&mdash;The Tsung-li Yamen and Board
of War were ordered to report on the suggestion that
the Imperial Courier posts should be abolished in favour
of the Imperial Customs post; and the establishment
of newspapers was encouraged.</p>

<p><i>September 13th.</i>&mdash;The general right to memorialise
the Throne by closed memorials was granted; and on
the same date Manchus who had no taste for civil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">611</a></span>
or military office were allowed to take up trades or
professions.</p>

<p><i>September 14th.</i>&mdash;The two Presidents and four Vice-Presidents
of the Board of Rites were dismissed for
disobeying the Emperor's order that memorials should
be sent to him unopened, whatever their source.</p>

<p><i>September 15th.</i>&mdash;The system of budgets as in
Western countries was approved.</p>

<p>It will be at once evident that the Emperor and his
party had raised up many powerful enemies, and should&mdash;had
they been wise&mdash;have secured the assistance
of the army in the first instance. It was when they
attempted to secure troops that the end came. It is
also evident that several of the reforms were what
every one would agree are absolutely necessary for
China; and although they may have made too many
at once, the exact rate at which reforms can be successfully
carried has never been calculated. Nor is there
any evidence even yet that they were going too fast
for the country. They would always have moved
too fast for the officials whose offices they abolished.
At the same time there is a certain sort of <i>doctrinaire</i>
flavour about this multiplicity of schools started at
once, and encouragement given to newspaper writers.</p>

<p>Since then the Empress-Dowager has in her own
name gone rather further in the opposite direction&mdash;and
raised up a yet larger number of enemies&mdash;forbidding the
establishment of societies of any sort, and ordering the
officials to arrest the members and punish them according
to their responsibilities. The chiefs are to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">612</a></span>
executed summarily, and the less responsible banished
into perpetual exile. This affects the Patriotic Association,
as also the new societies that were formed for
the engaging of teachers and purchase of scientific
books after the Emperor's decree doing away with
the five-chapter essay, and ordering that mathematics
should be an essential subject in examination. The
Empress has also suppressed all newspapers, and summarily
sentenced their editors to death. She has
also ordered that no further steps should be taken
to drill or arm the soldiery according to Western
methods, but that they should revert to bows and
arrows, and to the contests in running and lifting heavy
weights of ancient usage. The Emperor had signified
his intention of presiding at the next military examinations,
which were to have been in target-shooting
with modern weapons of precision. The Empress has
now announced that, instead of this, not even the
candidates need present themselves at Court. And all
the promising schemes for opening lower and middle
schools of Western learning are nipped in the bud&mdash;those
for girls, as before mentioned, in Shanghai, having
for safety been put under foreign management.</p>

<p>The most powerful man in China for the moment
seems to be Jung Lu, a Manchu who has spent
most of his life in military offices at Peking, but was
at one time general in Shensi, and as Viceroy of
Chihli&mdash;the office so long held by Li Hung-chang&mdash;was
much liked by foreigners at Tientsin. He is
reported, however, not to have slept for two nights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a></span>
with anxiety as to what the British fleet was doing at
Pehtaiho just before the <i>coup d'état</i>; and if that is the
case, he is not a man of that iron stuff that his mistress
will long be able to lean upon. The real power behind
the Throne, according to Kang, is a sham eunuch,
Li Luen-yên, the man whom every one who wants
an audience has for years past had to bribe heavily.
Li Hung-chang, the Empress's firm adherent during
all her long tenure of power, is beginning to be known
in England. Of Shêng, once his creature, but who
managed during Li's absence in Europe to attain such
lucrative posts as to look down upon his former patron,
the following story is told. His health never being
very good, Shêng had been accustomed to get leave
of absence from Tientsin in winter, and go to enjoy
himself in his native city of Soochow, the Paris of
China, and with also a much softer climate. During
the Japanese War it was felt impossible to give a
man in such high place leave of absence. But he
was dispensed from regular official work, and allowed
therefore to close the public offices under his control.
This was done, and they were reopened by him as
gambling-houses, where every man of business in
Tientsin must lose his money if he hoped to put
through a job or a contract under the corrupt administration
of Shêng. It may be remembered the British
Government demanded the latter's head a few years ago;
but, as in the case of Chou Han, who disseminated the
vile anti-Christian publications from Hunan, their demands
were put off by being told he was either not to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">614</a></span>
found, or mad, or something or other. It is men
like this that must corrupt any nation in which they
hold high power. It is men like this who are always
ready to receive high bribes from foreign powers. The
countries that wish to see China decadent, feeble, torn by
internal divisions, and under their control, have a direct
interest in supporting the late Dowager, now usurping
Empress, Tze Hsi, and the men who rally round her.</p>

<p>But those who do not wish to appropriate Chinese
territory, but rather that both the Chinese and themselves
should enjoy tranquillity, so as to develop each
their own territories to their highest capacity, must
wish to see in power men like Chang-chih-tung, the
one Viceroy never even accused of peculation, and <i>who
never visits Peking</i>, and other men of high aims and
upright conduct&mdash;making mistakes possibly, but at least
trying their best to elevate and guide the most peace-loving
and law abiding people that ever existed. The
Chinese may, as Lord Wolseley has predicted, make
good soldiers some day. But from time immemorial
they have despised war. And as in our men-of-war I
have heard that in battles in old days mattresses would
be hung over the ships' sides to protect them, so we
might do worse than interpose between fiery, mysterious
India and the other nations of Asia the impenetrable,
apparently yielding, but never really yielding, big
feather-bed of vigorous, healthy China, relieved from
her corrupt and disastrous Mandarin system, with her
men's minds freed from the cramping influence of a too
ancient system of education, and her women set upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">615</a></span>
their feet so as to be once more able to bear noble
sons. With all the nations of the West contending
who is to have its bones to pick, it is necessary that
some nation or nations should in the first instance stand
by China. But once let some great Western nation
make it plain to the world that he who attacks China
attacks her, and there will be no attack. And let
China's feet but once be set firmly in the ways of
progress, and there will be no going back.</p>

<p>I conclude with the words of the man whom I believe
to be the wisest statesman of the day, although to
my mind he too often lacks the decision to act in accordance
with his own judgment. Lord Salisbury in June,
1898, said: "If I am asked what our policy in China is,
my answer is very simple. It is to maintain the Chinese
Empire, to prevent it from falling into ruins, to invite
it into paths of reform, and to give it every assistance
which we are able to give it, to perfect its defence or
to increase its commercial prosperity. By so doing we
shall be aiding its cause and our own." Excepting
through the Victoria College, years ago established in
Hongkong, where and when, may I ask, has the British
Government acted on this policy laid down by the Prime
Minister with the strongest following of any Minister
of modern times?</p>
